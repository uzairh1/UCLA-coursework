 
WHO HAVE A HARD TIME 
EVACUATING, GETTING OUT AND 
NEED HELP. WE WANT TO GO TO JOY
WHO IS FOLLOWING THE FIRE IN 
THE EATON FIRE IN ALTADENA. 
WE'VE SEEN HOMES GO UP IN 
FLAMES BEHIND YOU AS WELL. 
>> WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH 
RIGHT NOW, IT WAS SO HARD TO 
HEAR THOSE FOLKS TALKING TO 
AMANDA A SHORT TIME AGO. WE ARE
LIVE ON LAKE AVENUE. THIS IS A 
BUSY BUSINESS CORRIDOR. WHAT 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS MOTION 
LIT. IT'S A BUSINESS ON HERE. 
IF YOU LOOK OVER TO THE 
LEFTHAND SIDE. THIS USED TO BE 
A CLEANER. WE HAVE LIFETIME 
BRAKES. ANOTHER BUSINESS 
HOLLOWED OUT BECAUSE OF THESE 
FLAILS THAT CONTINUE TO BURN 
AND SMOLDER. IF YOU LOOK DOWN 
THE ROAD WE HAVE ANOTHER, I 
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A 
BUSINESS OR AN APARTMENT 
COMPLEX. THAT IS ON FIRE. ALSO 
A TOTAL LOSS. WE'RE MOVING 
DOWN THE STREET. YOU CAN SEE 
THE CARS THAT HAVE BEEN 
DAMAGED. GUTTED BECAUSE OF THE 
FLAMES THAT CONTINUE TO TEAR 
THROUGH HERE RIGHT NOW. OVER 
BEHIND US IS A HOME. THIS IS 
ALAMEDA STREET. WE DO HAVE FIRE
CREWS THAT HAVE BEEN HARD. AS 
YOU TURN DOWN THIS RESIDENTIAL 
STREET YOU SEE THAT DARKNESS 
TAKES OVER BECAUSE OF THE 
SMOKE. AS THESE THINGS CONTINUE
TO BURN. I TALK ABOUT THE LIFE 
TIME BREAKS. IT IS VERY HOT. 
THAT ONE IS STILL BURNING. 
MAYBE 20 MINUTES OR SO AGO YOU 
CAN SEE THE BLACK SMOKE TAKING 
OVER. A HOME BEHIND US THAT HAS
CAUGHT FIRE. YOU HAVE THESE 
CARS THAT ARE PARKED ON THIS 
ROADWAY. UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE
ALSO GOING TO GO UP IN FLAMES. 
THERE WERE TWO HOMES THEY WERE 
WORKING ON TRYING TO PUT OUT 
THE FIRE. OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO 
PREVENT THAT FIRE FROM 
SPREADING. THAT'S WHAT 
FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN WORKING 
ON THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. NOT 
TRYING TO SAVE THE ONE FIRE. 
ONE HOME ALREADY ON FIRE. 
UNFORTUNATELY YOU COULD SEE 
THOSE FLAMES COMING TOWARDS 
THOSE HOMES. THERE'S NOT 
REALLY MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE. 
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR HOMES I 
CAN SEE JUST FROM WHERE I AM 
RIGHT NOW IN THIS VANTAGE 
POINT. TO BE HONEST, YOU CAN'T
SEE A LOT RIGHT NOW WITH THE 
SMOKE THAT IS BILLOWING THROW 
HERE. THAT IT WAS LIKELY A GAS 
TANK THAT JUST EXPLODED BEHIND 
ME. THIS IS AN ACTIVE FIRE. IT 
IS STILL BURNING. IT'S NOT 
UNDER CONTROL. IT IS DOWN RIGHT
SCARY. IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE
IN THIS COMMUNITY, IF YOU ARE 
SAFE SOMEWHERE. AS I SAID 
BEFORE, PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO 
COME BACK. JUST BE THANKFUL 
THAT YOU AND YOU ARE OKAY AND 
BE THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE 
AND LET THE FIREFIGHTERS TO 
THEIR BEST TO TRY TO PROTECT 
MANY OF THESE OTHER FIRES FROM 
BURNING. WE'LL HEAD BACK OUT 
TO THE STREET WHERE IT'S LESS 
SMOKY. BEFORE WE DO, TURN 
AROUND. 360 DEGREES. THERE'S 
FIRE BURNING IN ALL 360 DEGREES
OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. AND 
SOME VERY EXHAUSTED 
FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ALL NIGHT; RIGHT, 
CAPTAIN? SO SORRY, SIR. 
>> JOY. 
>> AS WE CONTINUE TO WALK BACK 
OUT TO LAKE AVENUE. YOU CAN SEE
THE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING OVER
ON THE OTHER SIDE. I SHOULD 
MENTION I'M ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY
FROM ELLIOTT MIDDLE SCHOOL. 
THAT WE WERE AT WHEN WE STARTED
OUR LIVE SHOT. THEY DO HAVE A 
CREW THERE. DID NOT APPEAR THE 
SCHOOL HAD CAUGHT FIRE. THERE 
WAS A LOT OF SMOKE IN THE 
DISTANCE AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE
SMOKE AND FLAMES IN EVERY 
DIRECTION UP HERE ON WHAT IS A 
VERY BUSY BUSINESS CORRIDOR. 
THERE IS JUST NOT MUCH THAT CAN
BE DONE AS THINGS ARE JUST 
FALLING AND CRASHING ALL AROUND
US BECAUSE THIS FIRE IS 
LITERALLY CONSUMING EVERYTHING 
IN ITS SIGHT. THEY'RE LISTING 
THE ACREAGE BURNED AS 2000 
ACRES. I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUESS 
IT'S LARGER THAN THAT. 
>> JOY, IT LOOKS LIKE A WAR 
ZONE. YOU AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER A LONG TIME. YOU'VE 
COVERED A LOT OF FIRES. THE 
INTENSITY IN YOUR VOICE IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS STRIKING ME 
TO SEE THE 360 OF THE FIRE AND 
WHAT'S HAPPENING. DO YOU FEEL 
SAFE WHERE YOU'RE AT? 
>> I MEAN, I THINK, YOU KNOW, 
AS YOU SAID I'VE KNOWN YOU A 
LONG TIME, JAMIE. I'VE COVERED
A LOT OF FIRES. MY SAFETY LEVEL
MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN SOMEONE 
ELSE'S SAFETY LEVEL AS I HAVE 
COVERED A LOT OF FIRES. I WOULD
NOT BE STANDING HERE IF I DID 
NOT FEEL SAFE. IF MY 
PHOTOGRAPHER DID NOT FEEL SAFE.
BUT WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY COVERED A
LOT OF FIRES OVER THE YEARS SO 
MY SAFETY LEVEL IS A LITTLE 
MORE THAN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY
FEEL. IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR 
WITH FIRES, IF YOU DO NOT KNOW 
THE DIRECTION, IF YOU'RE NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH EMBERS FLYING 
AT YOU, THEN NO, YOU WOULD NOT 
FEEL SAFE. I DO NOT SUGGEST 
JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE ME 
STANDING OUT HERE ON A BUSY AND
BURNING STREET THAT YOU THINK 
BECAUSE I'M OKAY TO BE HERE 
THAT YOU'RE OKAY TO BE HERE. 
I'LL ALSO MENTION AND A LOT OF
FIRE CREWS DO THIS, OUR CAR IS 
RUNNING. THE KEYS ARE IN THE 
IGNITION SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NEED
TO BE ABLE TO RUN AT ANY 
MOMENT'S MOMENT. WE DID THE 
360, WE CAME OUT TO LAKE 
AVENUE. WE'LL TRY AND GET YOU 
DOWN THAT ROAD AND SHOW YOU 
SOME OF THE DESTRUCTION A 
LITTLE BIT LATER ON WHEN THE 
WINDS AREN'T SO STRONG THAT I 
CAN SEE WHERE I AM. LOOK AT 
THIS. WE WERE WATCHING THIS 
CHEVROLET RIGHT HERE. THERE WAS
A LOG BURNING NEXT TO IT. IT 
WAS A FOOT AWAY . IT'S THE 
THINGS YOU DON'T REALIZE COULD
CATCH FIRE OR EXPLODE LIKE THAT
EXPLOSION YOU HEARD. THAT WAS 
LIKELY A GAS TANK. IT WAS A CAR
OR A GAS TANK IN A BARBECUE 
BEHIND SOMEONE'S HOUSE? I 
DON'T KNOW. WE CAN'T SEE. 
IT'S A FAMILIAR SOUND WHEN 
YOU'RE DEALING WITH A SCENE 
LIKE THIS. 
>> I WANTED YOU TO EXPLAIN TO 
PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M GETTING A 
LOT OF TEXT MESSAGES ASKING WHY
OUR REPORTERS ARE SO CLOSE TO 
SOME OF THESE FLAMES AND ARE 
YOU SAFE. THANK YOU FOR 
DESCRIBING THE MEASURES YOU 
HAVE IN PLACE AND PLEASE 
CONTINUE TO STAY SAFE.
