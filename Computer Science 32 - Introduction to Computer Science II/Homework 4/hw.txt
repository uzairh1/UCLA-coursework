1e. Test case 3 fails as vector v2's iterator is invalidated during the push_back operation triggered when k is equal to 2. In test case 1, no iterators are involved so this issue is not relevant. In test case 2, a list is being used. A list's iterators, however, do not become invalidated as its capacity changes.

3. The == operator, which Set::insert uses (since Set implements a container which orders its items) is not defined for two Coords.

4b. We would have no way to build up the path for each MenuItem.

5a. O(N^3). The first for loop runs a maximum of N times. The second for loop (inside the first for loop) runs a maximum of N times. The third for loop (inside the second for loop) runs a maximum N times. Everything else is a constant time operation.

5b. O(N^2 * i). The first for loop runs a maximum of N times. The second for loop (inside the first for loop) runs a maximum of i times. The third for loop (inside the second for loop) runs a maximum N times. Everything else is a constant time operation.

6a. In the worst case (i.e., result is a distinct set), get walks through s2 at cost O(N), and insert walks through the result at cost O(N). These two operations (at cost 2N) happen N times. So the time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^2).

6b. Copying all items into v, in the worst case, is an O(N) operation. Deleting result nodes is an O(N) operation -- a constant time operation being done N times. Copying unique items into v, in the worst case, is an O(N) operation. Destructing v is an O(n) operation. So the time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N) (O(N log N) sort dominates all other linear terms.)

6c. O(N). This algorithm walks through both sets at cost O(N), and the second for loop carries out a constant time operation N times.
