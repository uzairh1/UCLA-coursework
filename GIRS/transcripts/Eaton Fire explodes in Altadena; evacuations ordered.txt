coming in from this direction
getting closer to the school.
Just definitely a scary
situation. I'll go ahead and
send it back to you.
Matthew Seedorf, thank you.
We now move to a different part
of Southern California, which is
also on fire. This is the Eton
colleague Gina Silva is giving
us a look
Those areThose
are horses, horses, Gina.
Those are horses. Yes.
There's a woman that just came
down the road here and she's
trying to get her horses out of
here. But as you can see, we are
on New York Drive in Altadena,
and this entire hillside is on
fire. It has already crossed the
street. And there's a building
here that is in danger of also
going up in flames. I don't know
believe it said water, water
meters, something like that. But
you can see tincredible wind driven fire. The
Eden fire
At around 6:30
p.m. With just an estimated 20
acres and the blaze. As you can
see, it has quickly exploded
into more than 200 acres and it
keeps growing. There are so many
homes here in danger, and that
is why officials have issued a
mandatory evacuation order in
the area that is just west of
the Eden Canyon Course.
People living on these streets
also have to evacuate
immediately. And I heard a lady
earlier saying she didn't want
to leave because she's got so there was a sort
of a thing that was going back
and forth. But people living on
leave immediately. You can see
how dangerous the situation is.
These are the streets. Kanile'a
Canyon Road, Outpost Lane, Glen
Springs, Coolidge,
Roosevelt, Vanatta,
Can Claire
Drive. As you can see, this is a
fast moving
winds are absolutely wicked. And
I think that we are ourselves
are going to have to end up
moving because our vehicles are
down here and this just keeps
moving down. Now, we came from
my goodness. Thewere so strong it was difficult
to stand in one place. So we
were concerned that a fire could
break out out there. When this
one broke out and we were sent
see, Pasadena fire, LA County
fire, there are so many units
that are here battling this
blaze. As I said, there are so
And at this point, we did hear
that one home is on fire. And
right over here you can see more
people horses.
They're trying to rescue their
animals. Can you imagine just oh
my goodness, these embers flying
everywhere. Hi there. How many
more horses do you have?t let
loose over there. We're trying
to get as many as we can out.
Yeah. Are any homes out there
on fire?
attention. I just drove straight
to the barn to get my horses out
and get the rest of these guys
out. We're not going to let them
burn.
I got a bunch of trailers and
How many more? We don't know, I
don't know, I don't know how
many.
How many did you let out?
We took them. About four of
them in 2 or 3.
And another one. So there
should be at least maybe 12,
about 12.
Are there more people out
there right now? It's a whole
barn.
To get out. I got I a
I'll take that for. Two. Three.
What is that Ten, 11, 12.
There's 12. Yeah. No they're
pretty wired up. Yeah. They're
getting used to it. They're
getting used to it now. But w wind is blowing and the
embers are, they don't really
know what to do at first.
Have you seen anything like
this? Look at that hillside.
Yeah. I've rescued before.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Please be safe. Yeah.
Thank you. You'll be safe, too.
Yeah.
I think we're going to because I
could see all of the
firefighters that were stationed
at this l
And And the police
officers, they already left. And
again, this is New York
Boulevard. Altadena is Bradley. And the
building that is very close to
being on fire. And then maybe
before the end of the night
again, I don't know exactly what
it is, but I did see water
meters. What does it say here?
It's the Pasadena Tech Center.
Oh, wow. That's a that's in
danger right now.
Okay.
And the tech center.
I know you had heard at least
one home on fire when you made
your travels there. Did you
fire?
No, we didn't see any homes
On fire. We
on fire. We did see was the
large orange glow from the 210 black, black
smoke up there in the sky. And
it just was so ominous. It was
just, you know, when you look at
it, you're like, oh, no, this
cannot be good because it's
spreading so fast. These winds
are just unbelievable. We
couldn't stand straight when we
were in upland. And then as
you're driving. you don't
have to go anywhere, don't go
Driving is is
very dangerous right now. There
are there's so much debris on
the freeways. It's just coming
at you. It's just not it's
horrible, horrible driving
conditions.
So we just broke into
programing on Fox 11. So if you
were just joining us, welcome to
our Michaelson
Marla Tellez Gina Silva is
joining us right now from
Altadena. All day we've been
talking about this fire that we
have been watching in Pacific
Palisades. That's still burning
out of control. This fire now
burning out of control as well
in Altadena. Gina, can you talk
to us about what you're seeing
in terms of firefighters? I was
about to ask you about that a
moment ago. Then we saw some
firefighters get there. Are you
seeing a lot of firefighters at
work, or are you seeing a lot of
what we saw in Pacific
Palisades, which is a lot of
areas that they just can't get
to.
It's a really difficult area
to get to. But we did see L.A.
County Fire. I know that
Pasadena Fire is also here, and
And Los
Los Angeles. the forest fire is
also sending out information. So crews out
here, but we haven't seen that
many engines out here where we
are. It is possible they are in
the in the neighborhoods where
the homes are threatened in the
foothills. Again, this is the
Eden f
acres. And it keeps growing, of
course, with these winds, you
know, it's just a really
difficult spot, a difficult
