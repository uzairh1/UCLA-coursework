♪ >>> THE PALISADES FIRE IS ALREADY THE MOST DRUG DRUG DESTRUCTIVE IN L.A. HOUR. JACOB SOBOROFF AND KATY TUR GREW UP THERE. LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, THEY RETURNED TO FIND A HEARTBREAKING SCENE. >> PACIFIC PALISADES, A LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOOD 20 MILES WEST OF DOWNTOWN, IS THE EPICENTER OF THIS WEEK'S DISASTER. MORE THAN 5,000 HOMES AND STRUCTURES DESTROYED. 20,000 ACRES RAZED BY THE FLAMES. 40,000 PEOPLE ORDERED TO FLEE FOR THEIR LIVES. >> I GREW UP IN PACIFIC PALISADES. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THE WHOLE TOWN IS GONE AS WE KNEW IT. THIS IS THE PALISADES PUBLIC LIBRARY. IT'S STILL ON FIRE. I BROUGHT MY KIDS HERE, I DON'T KNOW, IN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS WITH THEIR LIBRARY CARDS THEY CHECKED BOOKS OUT OF HERE. LOOK AT THE FIRE STILL BURNING ON THE ROOF. THEN I DROVE ALONG THE WORLD-FAMOUS SUNSET BOULEVARD. TO ME, SUNSET BELOVED IS THE HEART OF MY COMMUNITY. THERE'S NOT A SINGLE HOUSE LEFT STANDING HERE. WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO THEY DO? ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS GREW UP HERE IN THE PALISADES TOO, MSNBC ANCHOR KATY TUR. HERE SHE IS AS A KID IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. A HEAVY HITTER GETTING A JUMP ON HER CAREER. WE DROVE THROUGH STREETS FILLED WITH OUR CHILDHOOD MEMORIES AND DREAMS. GROWING UP WE HAD FIRES TOO. DID YOU EVER EVACUATE? >> NO WE NEVER EVACUATED. >> THEY JUST THOUGHT FIRE WOULD BE CONTAINED BEFORE IT EVER GONE DOWN HERE. THIS IS THE MOST DENSELY PACKED AREA IN THE PALISADES. >> NOT A SINGLE HOUSE IS LEFT HERE. >> IF I WAS GOING HOME, I'D MAKE A LEFT ON THIS STREET. >> WAS THAT YOUR FRONT DOOR? >> YEAH. THIS WAS THE LIVING ROOMLE. WE PUT A CHRISTMAS TREE IN THIS CORNER RIGHT HERE. BEHIND THAT WAS A BATHROOM THAT MY DAD SET UP A DARKROOM FOR ME BECAUSE I LOVED PHOTOGRAPHY. >> OUR NOSTALGIA WAS SHORT LIVED. THERE'S TOO MUCH REAL MISERY HERE, TOO MANY LIVEDS UPENDED. >> DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NOW? WHAT WERE YOU ABLE TO GET WHEN YOU LEFT? >> NOTHING. >> BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THERE'S NO WAY, RIGHT? >> I WAS WORKING REALLY HARD. I WAS WORKING. I DIDN'T KNOW AND I CAME OUT AND I SAW A FIRE BALL. I HAD TO GET OUT IMMEDIATELY. >> OH MY GOD. >> THIS IS EVERYTHING. I GRABBED ONE PAINTING. >> TODAY I MET TANNER. TANNER IS FROM MINNESOTA, BUT HAPPENED TO BE VISITING A FRIEND WHEN THE FLAMES ENGULFED THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEN THE HOUSE. HOW ARE YOU DOING? I THINK IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY YOU BARELY MADE IT OUT ALIVE. >> I'M DOING WELL. IT WAS A BIT OVERWHELMING. >> I'M A PROFESSIONAL STORM CHASER. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT FIRE FIGHT AND GIVE ME A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE. BEEN AROUND FIRES BEFORE, BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS. PRETTY MUCH EVERY HOUSE HERE GOT TAKEN OUT. >> YOU COULD SEE THE TREES ON FIRE. THE THOUGHTS THAT WERE GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD AT THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU REALIZED WE'VE GOT TO SAVE OUR LIVES? >> YEAH. >> WHAT WAS IT LIKE? >> JUST A SENSE OF DEFEAT. >> THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN INFERNO. >> EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE AROUND US. WE'RE GETTING IN HIS CAR, GOING DOWN THE STREET. IT'S THICK. YOU COULD HARDLY SEE. THERE WAS KIND OF THIS JUST SOMBER FEEL IN THE CAR. YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE IT. >> JUST NEARBY, CTHIS CAFE USED TO BE THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITY. NOW IT'S A PILE OF CHARRED RUBBLE. >> THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE. >> THIS MAN HAS WORKED IN PACIFIC PALISADES FOR 34 YEARS. I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR ALMOST AS LONG. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THIS PLACE THAT MADE IT SO SPECIAL AND SO POPULAR? >> THE ENORMOUS EFFORT TO MAKE IT A SECOND HOME FOR EVERYBODY. >> WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO BE HERE? >> I HAVE CRIED SO MUCH. IT'S SO HARD. IT'S SO HARD. IT'S SO HARD. >> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? >> RIGHT NOW AS FOR MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING THIS TRAGEDY, OUR IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN. I DON'T KNOW. >> WHEN YOU COVER THESE THINGS, YOU ALWAYS HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT I CAN'T IMAGINE IT HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, TO ME. I LOOK AROUND THE TOWN, THE NEIGHBORHOOD, THE PLACE I GREW UP IN. I TALK TO MY FRIENDS WHO I SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH ON THESE STREETS. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT COMES NEXT AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. AS THE FIRE CONTINUES TO EAT AWAY COMMUNITIES, YOU HARDLY DARE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. CAL FIRE DEPUTY DIRECTOR NICK SHULER. >> IN MY 26 YEARS THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE TOP MOST DEVASTATING FIRES I'VE SEEN. >> WHAT HAPPENS IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE THE HIGH SCHOOL IS DESTROYED, CHURCHES, SUPERMARKETS DESTROYED?
