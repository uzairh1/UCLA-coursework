SANTA ANA WINDS.
>> JOY BENEDICT IS IS WHERE THE
EATON FIRE IS STILL BURNING.
YOU HAVE FLAMES ALL AROUND YOU.
>>Reporter: YEAH, WE DO.
WE ARE LIVE RIGHT NOW.
WE ARE ON LAKE AVENUE.
THIS IS A VERY BUSY BUSINESS
DISTRICT BUSY BURNING.
IF YOU LOOK AROUND.
THIS WAS A BUSINESS OVER HERE
BEHIND US.
ANOTHER BUSINESS BURNING A SHORT
DISTANCE AWAY.
FOOD STORE AND LIQUOR STORE HAVE
BURNED TO THE GROUND.
IF YOU LOOK UP TOWARDS THE
NORTH.
YOU CAN SEE MORE BUSINESSES
CONTINUING TO BURN.
NOT ONLY ON LAKE AVENUE BUT OVER
HERE TO THE LEFT.
WE HAVE THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE
ALL READY BURNED OVER THERE
ACROSS THE STREET.
THIS FIRE IS JUST CONSUMING
EVERYTHING IN SIGHT ON THIS
ENTIRE FOUR CORNER AREA.
THIS IS AS YOU GET A VANTAGE
POINT.
IT'S VERY ALARMING TO SEE.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE
BUILDING LIKE THIS ONE LOOKING
AT THE SOUTHEAST CORNER HERE OF
LAKE AND MARIPOSA.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS WAS.
IT COULD HAVE BE RESIDENTIAL OR
BUSINESS OR BOTH.
IT'S GUTTED FROM THE
INSIDE-OUT.
IT CONTINUES TO BURN AND WE SEE
THIS UP AND DOWN LAKE AVENUE.
I'M SEEING FIRE TRUCKS.
THEY ARE TRYING TO SAVE WHAT
THEY CAN.
THEY ARE TRYING TO PROSECUTE
EVENT THIS FIRE FROM SPREADING
TO PLACES THAT ARE NOT ALL READY
ON FIRE.
THIS ALL ENCOMPASSING AND ON
EVERY STREET AND TAKING OVER
EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD.
THERE IS NO WAY TO GET ALL OF
WE DON'T HAVE THE FIREFIGHTERS.
WITH THE WINDS AS THEY ARE RIGHT
NOW, YOU WON'T GET THE WATER
DROPS THE COMMUNITY SO
DESPERATELY NEEDS.
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE STANDING
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S A LOT OF DESTRUCTION.
YOU CAN HEAR THE ALARMS AND
SIRENS.
THEY ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES
UP HERE.
ESPECIALLY IN A LOT OF THE
BUSINE
REPORTER: HE IS NOT STOPPING SOOBVIOUSLY, HE'S IN A HURRY AND
HE IS MARRIED NETWORK OF THE
MIXER THAT EVERYBODY GETS OUT OF
HIS WAY WE OBVIOUSLY WILL AND
HOPEFULLY EVERYONE ELSE WILL AS
WELL LET'S TALK A BIT FURTHER
DOWN HERE ON THE STREET SO THAT
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THIS
DISTRACTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT HAS A FIRE HAS
COME IN FROM OTHER THIS
DIRECTION AGAIN, HE WAS STILL
SEE SOMETHING STILL BURNING.
BUT THERE IS NOTHIN TO DO WITH
THOSE FLAMES THEY'RE BASICALLY
GOING TO LET THESE BUSINESSES
JUST BURN OUT THAT IS PRETTY
STANDARD PROCEDURE WHEN YOU'RE
DEALING WITH A FIRE THAT IS THIS
MASSING ALIKE RESOURCE THAT WE
HAVE IS NOT LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE
ONE BUSINESS THAT CATCHES ON
FIRE, AND THEN THEY WILL SIT
THERE AND THEY WILL TRY TO PUT
IT OUT BRAIDED THERE'S JUST
EVERYTHING IS BURNING IN THE
GOVERNOR TO THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE,
AND THIS IS WHEN I AM TALKING
ABOUT A YEAR AND IF YOU LOOK AT
THESE BUSINESSES, WE HAVE THIS
BUILDING THAT THANKFULLY HIM
THESE BUSINESSES HAVE NUMBERED.
BUT NEXT IT, WE HAVE A BUILDING
THAT IS COMPLETELY GUTTED OVER
HERE I WOULD APPEARS TO BE THE
ALTADENA TRUE VALUE HARDWARE
THAN THEY BELIEVE THAT'S BEEN
HERE VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME
AND THIS IS NO BUILDING.
WE VERY BUILDING THAT IS BEEN
STANDING FOR A LONG TIME AND
NEVER TO THE LEFT-HAND SIDE, WE
HAVE A MORE DESTRUCTION AND IT
IS REALLY WHAT WE SEE ALL
THROUGHOUT OUT ALTADENA ON EACH
AND EVERY STREET THAT IS EAST OF
LAKE AVENUE AND WERE JUST SEEING
A LOT OF THIS, SOME THINGS THAT
ARE EITHER CONTINUING TO BURN
THEMSELVES OUT FOR A LOT OF
THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY
OCCURRED.
IT IS JUST REALLY HARDENS REALLY
CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD INTO
THE WEST DIRECTION NOW AND THIS
IS ALL MENINO AVENUE AND IS NOT
HARD TO SEE AS I AM LOOKING OUT
HERE FORWARD IN THIS DIRECTION
THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THESE HOMES
WITH USED TO BE HOMES OVER HERE.
THEY'RE GONE.
I GUESS I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU CAN
SEE THIS BUT WILL BE HAVE RIGHT
HERE, THIS YEAR WAS A
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY AND A
MEANS OF THESE WERE LINED WITH
HOMES HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY AND
RIGHT NOW, YOU DO NOT SEE
ANYTHING IN FRONT OF US, JUST
THE DEVASTATION OF THE CAR AND
HOMES THAT YOU SEE IN THE
MEMORIES THAT TURN TO ASK WHAT
IS BEEN JUST A DISRUPTIVE AND IS
FITTING I FOR SO MANY HERE IN
THIS ALTADENA COMMUNITY AND YOU
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THESE ARE
FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND TAKES
HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS FOR
THESE THINGS TO BURN SO I DO NOT
EVEN KNOW WHEN THESE ORIGINAL
WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY CAUGHT FIRE
PRESENT BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT
WAS SOMETIME AGO THEY WILL
CONTINUE TO WORK IN BRINGING
SUBS OUT.
GUYS, IS A TOUGH DAY FOR SOME
APPEARANCE COMMUNITY.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ELSE TO
SAY EXCEPT THAT IT IS JUST SO
HEARTBREAKING.

YOU CAN DESCRIBE WHAT WE SEE IN
