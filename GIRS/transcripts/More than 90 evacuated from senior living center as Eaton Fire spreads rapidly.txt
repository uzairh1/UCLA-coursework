next to this area when we were talking to to you earlier we mentioned that there was a nursing home and an assisted living home that did have to be evacuated that was at the intersection of Altadena and Washington and I want to show you some of that video that we have of people being evacuated that was the park Terraces and the Pasadena Wellness Center those areas there were 96 people that had to be evacuated people in gurns people in wheelchairs people in Rolling beds being rushed out out of that assisted living home out of that nursing home uh 96 of them transported and evacuated to Los felis we talked to a woman who rushed over here from Arcadia to help her mom she had been in she had had power going in and out all day so it was really hard for her to understand the situation and what was going on but if you take another look live look back out here you can see the Flames have just gotten bigger and bigger that black smoke right in front of us here at the Pasadena Jewish temple and Center
