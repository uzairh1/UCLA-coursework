Yes, many are trying to evacuate and that's legit, but most are just lookylous getting in the way. I'd like to blame it on ""California idiots"" but this really does happen everywhere. I only worked emergency relief once long ago and am not a professional by any means, but I am intelligent enough to know that all I am likely to contribute in such a situation is to make things worse, so I stay home and watch on YouTube (unless I needed to evacuate and, hopefully, I had the means to do so before it was too late)."

Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-09T01:17:57Z,1.4,0.24,4,"If the fires get much worse I hope the insurance companies can cover all the losses.  I heard some people say there were houses that cost upwards of $10 million but there were also cases of houses that had their insurance policies canceled due to fire risk.  It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.
I had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."

Her facility's been without electricity for a day now and she's on the 2nd floor and can't use the elevator. The phones aren't working at the facility and my mom's phone lost battery so I can't get in contact and I'm watching all of this from New Jersey. I just hope they contain this fire before it comes down the mountain to the surrounding buildings even more.

Growing up in Southern California in the San Gabriel Valley, I recall seeing fires in the mountains every summer but they were always contained and never came down the mountains. Now it's seems like they are so powerful and devastating and he's right, it's really dry there now, more so then I remember as a child in the 70's and 80s."

Palisades Fire,notification,2025-01-08T23:44:11Z,1.0,0.149,0,"Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way. He wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of California. Now the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes. A true disaster!"

High winds spreads the inferno in rich white communities turning homes into ash.
