you just rode up here on your bike i r


up here on my bike just to see if I can


help you you told me the school on taso


the the pal school that's burning that's


bur part Burly the bleachers on the


football field are gone houses just down


further down the cany are gone so I also


sced around to see if any of my friends


were still here so we could find out how


to get out if we need to get out what's


a good out well there was a traffic jam


earlier right past the high school


people were here here to the 405 but the


the high school at that around


new that was five oh here we watch it


all the way race right AC the here this


place hasn't been since the 70s it is b


as up there look at


this


gu Y and I think it's time for us to go


too um he just showed you that video I


don't know if you're able to see it but


that's proof and evidence further up the


road homes burned to the ground it was a


a horrible sight to see that on his


phone it's just right here I can tell


you this home is beginning to burn as


well and what I saw further up just


horrible other homes burn to the ground


back to you Pat yeah we do want you to


get out of there you know why I say that


Juan in your sha Jasmine it looks like


we can see just a trail of like look


looks what looks like burning leaves


behind you there as you were talking


being blown by the wind just down the


street there so yes that's exactly what


I'm talking about so we certainly want


you to stay safe out there


J yeah I think it's like a construction


one of these homes under construction


and they had a huge pile of dirt and


leaves and that was beginning to catch


fire and blow this direction yeah and


that's just even presents more danger


you know I would guess the good thing


that you talked about jazz that nobody's


there MH they're all gone GH yep I'm


glad that guy's getting out of here too


no question all right Jazz we'll talk to


you a bit later okay well that that


gives you a good look at what's going


out there right you know this is another


live look at the fire from a different


neighborhood and our K Cal news reporter


Elise Martinez has been live near the


scene moments after this fire broke out


and she has the very latest now


for all right so it's a little chaotic


here we're on PCH near T Mescal Canyon


and we've been driving up and down PCH


but a lot of the time black smoke would


just cross over PCH and we did see some


palm trees on fire at one point and now


this entire Hillside behind me is just


going up in Flames there's a lot of


chaos here because people are still


driving around trying to get out we've


got a firefighter in this parking lot


who's telling people you know to keep it


moving to get out of here that it's not


safe we heard that firefighter told me


but it's not confirmed that a Will


Rogers State Building which is just down


the way is on fire so we're trying to


get that confirmed we did not see that


ourselves but that's what a firefighter


said that he was hearing that was going


on but again you can just see those


Flames picking up I do have someone here


who just evacuated his home come on in


and join me thanks so much for talking


to me tell me your first name again


Danny Danny Danny stayed in his home


until about 30 minutes ago tell me where


your home is and what the situation was


when you left uh I live in P bow there


about 172 residents there and I was one


of the last ones to leave I held out to


last as long as I could um when I left I


parked over at tascal so I get a fast


faster getaway when I got to my car both


sides of tastical warn fire so um I got


basically just in time and you you said


you're it's a mobile home area and other


homes there were on fire we saw that


didn't we homes there no not yet I don't


think any and I don't think it's it's


got that I'm trying to trying to find


that out I was trying to walk back here


but it gets


that that it's it's besides all the


smoke it's hard to see and it's hard to


breathe so it's only only go a certain


amount of distance before you have to


back up so I'd like to see if my place


on fire yeah and you said that your


feeling was that you were going to lose


it you were going to lose your home you


weren't sure I'm yeah I'm not sure


there's always hope but I'm expecting


the worst you are okay and where are you


headed since you're now evacuated I


parked I parked about 100 yards or so


back there I spent and then we'll figure


it out after that all right well thank


you so much I hope everything goes okay


but again just one of the people who


stuck it out uh he's just telling us he


evacuated within the last 30 minutes and


you know he's hoping to get the news


that his home is okay but again just the


wind is so intense that it is just


picking up these Embers and carrying


them them everywhere and then all these


spot fires erupting I'd say 30 minutes


ago this part of the Hill Hill Side


wasn't this intense wasn't burning like


this and it's just the winds are just


whipping this fire up so intensely and


the scariest part was driving down PCH


and at some points you couldn't see the


road ahead of you because there was so


much black smoke and that smoke is just


blowing towards us blowing towards the


ocean and every once in a while those


gusts just really kick up like right now


our door I have to shut our door it flew


open so again just a very scary


situation here if you don't have to be


in this area don't be in this area


they're trying to clear out these


parking lots that are right next to the


beach because a lot of people are coming


and parking here and they're telling


everybody just to get out but again it's


night time now it's dark and you can


really see those Flames burning here on


PCH you sure can so intense Elise and


burning right there off PCH just


incredible to see that P and you know if


you've traveled PCH even if you have not


been to this place in particular you can


see it uh from the street and we're


going to go to our Tom white now who is


at the Getty Villa and that's right off


PCH Tom how's how's it going out there


is that structure


safe uh it is impossible to tell Pat


because the visibility here is such a


nightmare you can barely see you know


just a few yards in front of you we're


right across


from the Getty Villa and you can see the


glow of flames and all that smoke there


right on the hillside that leads up into


the villa and then Greg let's swing over


here you can see just how much flame and


fire that firefighters are dealing with


here the conditions are just miserable


where we are right now it is so


difficult to breathe difficult to see


you can see the Flames of cross PCH I'm


not even turning my mic into the wind I


I'm standing and trying to block it


because it's so windy where we are that


it it's creating a completely just


horrific dangerous conditions for


firefighters it looks like the the wind


is blowing toward in out into the ocean


at this moment but it's sort of manic


it's whipping around and the hillside


though there by the Getty it just it's


very ominous it is we are seeing Plains


but I can't even see up the hill it's


just terrible conditions we were just in


um


neighborhood uh just north of PCH or


sorry just just to the east of PCH and


it was um it was just also the same


conditions visibility there's just so


much smoke and and that's just making it


so challenging for firefighters we saw a


number of firefighters working to


contain uh the Embers that were flying


around and kind of in that particular


neighborhood um and then we came down


here and we could see the Getty Villa


and the flames on the hillside and it


just you can see it looks like um


dystopian there I mean the uh it looks


like like a Char planetary landscape or


something there's just uh look at that


as the winds just whip up look at how


intense that that that is right there on


the hillside and the Flames just you


know climbing up and racing up that


Hillside we just oh there now you can


finally see the villa okay you could


finally make it out there I think I I


don't know if if there's


looks like there's some flame on on


something I don't know what it's so hard


to see what that is Greg do I mean can


you tell what that is from here I don't


know yeah and we can't tell uh but


there's Flames it looks like on some


sort of structure but I don't know for


certain what that is it's it's just so


hard to tell but for a second there you


could actually see the Villa or or a


structure near it um but it's very


disorienting the the amount of smoke and


and just it's it's very challenging I


can only imagine how difficult this is


for firefighters trying to to get a


handle on this um but but there just


along the road you could see just along


that the the retaining wall there that's


that it's burned um I'm trying to get a


I want to let folks know where I was


just a a few moments ago and it it and


because it was good news up there was


that it was uh blue Sail Drive that's


where we just were we went to the top of


the hill and it looked a lot of the


homes there looked fine a lot you know


for people who lived there it it did not


look like any of the homes were engulfed


it looks like firefighters were really


meticulously going through that


neighborhood and trying to douse hotpots


make sure that none of the homes were


you know sort of the The Embers were


inside roofs or attics um there were


some the houses though I was told by a


firefighter there that were either


damaged or on fire but but it was not an


overwhelming amount I was I was we we we


went through the neighborhood so uh so


there some positive news there for


people yeah it looks like we lost uh


Tom's microphone for just a sec and you


know Pat before there was the Getty


museum there was the Getty Villa and


there's still so many um Antiquities


inside that building beautiful centuries


old Antiquities that have been on


display there for the public to see and


and it would just be such a shame if if


the fire overtakes that building back


okay Tom you're back with


us I think I'm back with you yeah so


we're just trying to figure out what


that is Pat up there it's so hard to


tell um if if that's vegetation burning


up there but we got like finally like


the outline of what I believe is the


Getty Villa um at the top of the hill


but you know uh with these with now


night plus the the smoke obscuring


everything it's just so hard to tell but


but certainly it's a very dangerous


situation precarious situation because


you see all you can see the


the the smoldering Hillside and that is


you know when when we just had a big


gust a few minutes ago it lit up it just


it it like it fanned the Flames it it


it's like if you go to a barbecue and


and start you know Fanning the coals and


they then they start you know getting


brighter that's what it looked like I


I'm not sure how how much it translated


there on the screen um but but but


certainly um firefighters are here on


the scene and they are um they they are


attacking this a lot they have a lot of


people on this a lot of personnel they


they of course will be fighting this


intensely um but they're spread so thin


you would as you would imagine just


having to to get through all these


neighborhoods and try and we just saw


there was another round of of sheriffs


or or lepd going through and making


evacuation orders in that neighborhood I


was just talking about um up in I


believe it was Blue Trail um Road I want


to verify that one more time just to


make sure uh blue sail blue Sail Drive


um so we heard we heard them through the


loudspeaker making evacuations there


again and of course the there were


already evacuation orders in place in


that area um but you know and and just


driving through me there was another


spot along Sunset just just off of PCH


where there was cars burning um and I


think we may have had reporters there


earlier too but but we saw cars burning


in that lot uh just across the street


from a strip mall so just so much damage


here and and just the the the weather is


so manic right now it finally is calming


down a little bit but it picks back up


uh Pat you remember we were live all


night on the fire in Malibu just you


know a few weeks ago and it's the same


situation um you know we were talking


about then and and you know Juan I know


you've been out covering these things as


well it's like that those moments where


you have uh a few a few seconds where oh


maybe it's calming down and then it just


blows up again MH you know what I I also


called from that the Malibu fire is


because it was so dark and Smoky we


didn't have a clear picture as to what


was um on fire and the reason I say that


I'm not just talking about uh homes that


there was a particular structure a


particular area um that we thought could


have been on fire and it wasn't thank


goodness I think it had it was a lab of


some kind so we're hoping that this


applies to the Getty Villa if if I'm not


mistaken one I think they're still doing


some construction or work on it on the V


they're always doing a little something


to it yeah to bring it looks like there


a fence that's on fire up there it looks


like the fence that's what that's what


it's looking like from this angle okay


but you know what I don't think the


actual structure that's that's that's


good maybe a retaining fence of some


sort yeah and you did mention that there


were still some firefighters right um


Tom oh yeah absolutely yeah Pat there


they they they uh they have the area


swarmed I mean there's many many uh


engines we see from where we're standing


it's just like so Sur though looking at


the Getty Villa sign with the with this


smoke uh obscuring it and then looking


up the hill and seeing the Flames it


just it's it's heartbreaking and and


scary and I think that is the Villa


right there next to those yeah that is


the Villa but it doesn't look like those


Flames are on the Yeah Yeah and I don't


think you can see I I think now you can


actually make the Villa out I think


there on the top of the hill okay I


think Mike um Tom stand by I think Mike


Rogers has some updated information yeah


we just heard from Getty Villa uh the


structure itself is not on fire as we're


seeing in Tom's live shot here fences


Shrubbery trees are on fire but the


building itself according to the Getty


is not on fire the Getty also wants to


point out that the museum Galleries and


the library archives have been sealed


off by from Smoke by what they call


state-of-the-art air handling system so


not to damage or destroy anything that's


in there they also say that the walls


are double walled uh of the galleries so


it provides significant protection for


the collection so while they say the


building's not on fire even even if


their fire were to get there it sounds


like they've got it designed in a way


that the things inside of it would be


protected well that's we are really


happy to hear that Mike when you you


talk about um like others being affected


and we talk about the smoke and how


toxic it is you've got people that you


know from the west side that are


breathing in that smoke and and sending


in pictures of flames or well smoke that


they can see from from the marina from


um you know different parts of Southern


California and that certainly not going


to be safe because that's going to be


around for a while yeah AQMD has already


issued an air quality warning no wonder


for the area yeah well Pat I was coming


in around 11:00 a.m. uh this morning I


was in San Gabriel Valley and on the 10


freeway you could see that huge plume of


smoke up over it looked like it was up


and over downtown Los Angeles you


couldn't necessarily tell from the


vantage point where it was but we knew


it was the Pacific Palisades but this is


a fire uh storm that's going to be


affecting a lot of us as you said for


the coming days now question


open my front door and there was a big


plume of smoke I'm looking at over the


canyon and even coming in today uh folks


if you're on the freeways hopefully


you're not out but if you are you have


to be careful as well because there's


there's flying debris you know uh tree


bark flying all across the freeway and


streets because of these powerful winds


I think it's safe to say um that we've


taken some hits here in our our studio


since we've been on the air in fact I


believe at least four we've been


fortunate to have the power come back on


because of generator but uh a lot of


things that are are happening even if


you're not in the direct line of the


fire fire you've got street lights


traffic lights that are out and some


areas and some intersections so this


certainly impacts a much larger area


than um what we've been talking about


but that that what we're looking at


there in the Pacific Palisades is


impacting so many people when you think


about


30,000 people that they want to um


evacuate that is such a huge amount


that's even larger than the Malibu fire


is that correct I believe so I I believe


so as well I'll have to go back and look


at the exact numbers but to your point


Pat it is I mean look DWP is reporting


thousands and thousands of people


without power they're saying uh their


estimated restoration time is 4 to 12


hours if your power goes out so yeah


while we're talking about and focusing


on this life-threatening fire that is


happening in the Palisades it's a


reality for people all across our


viewing area with the wind and


everything else um I I want to come to


my map if we can because I want to point


something out we talked so much about


spotting and we talk so much about Ember


casts especially with the wind and where


it goes so this is the fire footprint


right one thing that the fire department


is currently dealing with that I just


cared come out so everywhere you see in


the red here uh all in this area that is


where the fire is actually burning what


I'm listening to right now is a


structure fire that came out at an


apartment building right in this area so


that you can see is not close to where


the fire is the nearest like section of


fire is over here but they said that an


em it sounded like an ember came and


landed on the roof of that apartment


building so they had to divert resources


over there they came out to do a uh


structure fire call over there and even


said we don't have the resources to


balance this to a full structure fire


assignment so what do you need and for


example engine 60 truck 60 are handling


that fire which is on Sunset Boulevard


their station Eng station 60 is in North


Hollywood so we've got fire Crews from


all over the region that are here and


now it sounds like we're dealing with a


fire that may have started from an ember


cast well you know we've been talking


about that all afterno as well how those


Embers are can just go from place to


place travel a bush a tree an eve and


you know things can happen Okay we're


going to give you the latest update uh


at the bottom of the hour here we want


to tell you the latest in the Palisades


fire the fire has now burned more than


1200 Acres since starting before 11:00


a.m. today and there is 0% containment


there are very active flames right now


well 30,000 residents are under


evacuation orders multiple structures


have burned 13,000 more are threatened


and that includes at least 10,000 homes


this is a widespread destructive


Windstorm and meteorologist oligo asena


has been tracking the conditions in the


Palisades and Olo what are firefighters


and residents up against right now at


this hour you know winds are kind of


winding down just a bit but we are in


for an increase in winds as we head into


later tonight and into tomorrow so if


you're feeling some of the calmer


conditions right now uh do not put your


guard down because we are in for quite


the stretch as we head into the coming


hours so the strongest winds will be


tonight right around 10:00 is when those


winds start to really intensify through


early tomorrow and you guys have been


talking about this even if you are just


on the roads you are going to feel it in


your car so take it easy if you are


still traveling tonight if you are


traveling early tomorrow morning as you


get on the road to head into work


because the critical fire danger


continues with it the US the peak of it


is going to continue still through


Wednesday but still through the end of


the week we have the red flag warnings


in place through Thursday and then the


fire we we watch that continues through


Friday so really throughout the week


through the entire rest of the work week


we're going to continue with elevated


fire danger because look at these wind


gusts we're talking 50 to 80 miles hour


and then isolated gusts in the 80 to 100


miles hour we've seen some wind gusts so


far in the 70s across some of our


Mountain areas so these are destructive


these are very dangerous winds and we're


seeing it pretty widespread right now in


Pacific Palisades in the 40s we're


seeing lots of 40s Malibu Beach as well


SEI Valley in the low 50s so these are


very strong Gusty winds that take it


easy out there here's a look at more of


those gusts in the past hour so we've


been in the mid 40s in Claremont 48 in


Burbank Santa Ana also in the mid-40s as


well as Lancaster in the 50s for sagus


and then up in the mountains we're


seeing those stronger gust nearing 60


MPH but these are not the peak of this


wind event so I'll take you through


future cast there are those stronger


gusts again usually in the higher


elevations so Foothills and mountains


from the San Gabriel Valley into the


Inland Empire we're seeing the strong


winds there as well heading into the


9:00 hour seeing some strong winds out


through parts of Orange County uh


getting a little stronger as we head


into the early part of Wednesday and


really widespread also for Ventura and


the LA County area seeing 45 to 70 mph


gust and for places like the analou


valley also seeing those strong winds


early on Wednesday so we'll take a look


at the red flag warnings the high wind


warnings and what to expect as we head


into the rest of the week and for the


weekend in just a few


minutes all right thank you so much Olga


um you know the the news there is that


these winds are we expect to continue


throughout the evening throughout the


evening padn into tomorrow morning so


it's something we going to keep an eye


on all night long all right well let's


go back to our Tom white now he is near


the Getty Villa somewhere off of PCH


Tom yeah that's right Pat um just


outside of where the entrance is and we


can take another look here I know it's


very hard to see what is going on here


right uh but I did get an update from


the Getty and they say that the


structure that we were looking at up


there on the top of the hill is the Via


de own um and my understanding is right


now nothing is on fire there um uh in


terms of structures obviously the


Hillside and the vegetation that's a big


issue and and there's obviously a very


uh big concern for firefighters trying


to trying to tackle all of this you can


see just how much fire is burning around


the property I mean the retaining wall


area there is a fencing uh area there


but let's go back to you I'm told to


wrap go ahead all right thanks so much


Tom let's go to Tesco Canyon and our


Jasmine Ville with the very latest from


there Jasmine you guys tamasco Canyon is


on fire we are burning on both sides


this is the high school to my left the


high school is burning the football


field all the hills onto mcal Canyon


this is right half Sunset right past


Sunset dve these are apartment buildings


and homes and again this is the


Palisades Charter High School this looks


to be the swimming area seems to be fine


but right up the road I don't know if


you can see if we walk right up here


fire trucks are zooming all over because


the


hills every side of Tasco is on fire we


had to get out of the ELO Avenue area


because ELO I think I have some video


that or we're trying to turn it around


but Alo Avenue is also now burning on


both sides as Embers are being pushed


across you see


that that that's what


wow literally pushing


me firefighter racing trying to deal


with okay just come up here a little bit


because these homes are gone on this


side of tasal Canyon I can't believe


this earlier this was a traffic jam cars


were Bumper to Bumper trying to get out


of here and this is exactly why they


were told to leave because they knew


that the flames and the fire could reach


down here eventually and sure enough it


has again most people have gotten 30,000


people in this evacuation Zone but this


was a traffic jam earlier so thank


goodness they all were able to leave


there was a bus stop on fire up here and


a lady trying to still leave and escape


on her bike carrying her bag and I


hopefully she got out of here I just saw


her up there on her bike riding through


the flying Embers all look at the side


of right there that's this over here


Oliver just went up and the high school


again it's just


heartbreaking you can


see right


here starting to catch on fire from the


football field so these Flames they're


now


blowing they're now blowing all over and


I'm breathing in


soot my ear piece just fell out so I


can't hear you guys very


well but anyway let me give you one more


look look we're going to


jump head out of here because it's just


too yeah too dangerous to be here as we


keep this fire just keeps pushing us


further and further closer to PCH we


started up there on Alo Avenue and you


can see those fles just raced over the


canyon and the hills and now we're even


we're that much closer to PCH so let me


leave you with that shot and I'll try to


find my earpiece I found it so you guys


can talk to me now it fell out of my ear


okay but but Jasmine you know we we're


concerned because when we see those ERS


burning right behind you even on on the


ground there but that that's you know


how that could just start another fight


so we're really concerned for your


safety even though you are really giving


us a a clear picture and an


understanding of just what is happening


where you are on domestical Canyon and I


can remember hearing um some sound


earlier of a family saying well our kids


at are at Pacific Palisades High School


we're not very worried about it right


now because they can just walk across


the street to the beach right but of


course you know when you look at what's


happened this was several hours ago and


to see what's happening right now that


is so okay Jasmine there we go it's time


to go J get in the truck honey and get


out of there time to go that's what


we're talking about that wind could just


kick up those Embers like that so sure


Jasmine is okay she's she's smart and


she's been doing this for a long time


but at the same time you know we're


going against um forces that we really


have no control over when it comes


wind and burning catching almost


anything on fire to the ground it was


very quick yeah so we're going to let


you know how how Jasmine is we know that


uh she's safe though we're sure that


she's in the truck and hopefully uh on


her way away from there another good


thing to note one is at least as Jazz


was talking we saw fire engines going


toward the direction that's right of


where those hom right now that the high


school and those apartment buildings


across the street um on fire so very


very sad I'm hoping that Rogers can


possibly give us an update a little


later there was oh there he is right now


there is a senior center a senior


citizen community that was in trouble


earlier today so we're going to get to


Mike in a minute but first we have


another one of our correspondents let's


go to Elise Martinez who's been covering


this all day long at


leise hi to you both we're still on PCH


we're just getting another gust of wind


and because we're so close to the ocean


we're getting sand whipped into to our


face right now it is just blowing so


hard on PCH near tascal Canyon getting


sand in my mouth as well we want to show


you what's going on behind us and then


we have a realtor who's been checking on


some of the homes for some of his


clients he's got some stuff in escra as


well we'll talk to him just a second but


we'll show you behind us those Flames


just so intense so close to PCH which is


now closed except for emergency vehicles


and then behind that ridgel line more


flames and behind that area there are a


bunch of homes so we don't know the fate


of those homes yet but again you can


just see especially at night how intense


those Flames are burning so close to PCH


as that wind keeps picking up all right


joining me now tell me your name and um


where you're from you said you were


coming from Venice yeah correct my name


is grant vasic grant we were talking you


were saying some of the most expensive


homes are behind those Hills right


behind us tell me about that and then


tell me about your clients as well okay


great yeah right behind us we have the


El medo Bluffs which is currently as you


can see the Flames are ripping up that


Ridge line there pushing towards the


Huntington from what we can see down


here but uh yeah first F first things


first I was supposed to be in the


Palisades early today when I got a text


from one of my inspectors around 10:30


saying that she saw plumes of smoke and


she lives in TOA Canyon so um she was


worried about road closures and whatnot


so she rushed home and then from there I


monitor the situation as it progressed


obviously it just uh erupted into more


flames and continued to grow at that


point all of our clients were getting


concerned and rushed back from work to


their houses um to grab animals and


important documents and then continue on


their way to try to um safely evacuate


and you said a lot of them said they


just don't even know what's going on


they don't know the state of their homes


right now a couple of our clients


confirm that their houses um were on


fire and they don't know the actual


result whether there was just some fire


damage or that I was complete loss at


this time um yeah most the majority of


our clients have no idea whether their


homes are standing or not all right


we're getting another gust of wind you


can see this guy is 6'5 and he's getting


pushed around um in these powerful wind


gusts we're both wiping our eyes even


though I have goas on the the sand is


just blowing this way again a very


serious situation here on PCH near T


Mescal Canyon pch in this area is shut


down except for just emergency vehicles


and again those Flames just picking up


in intensity as the night goes


on all right uh at least just uh you


know a a horrible situation there no


matter where you are right no absolutely


so we're glad that um you're in a safe


area we can see cars behind you and for


the longest time you see that uh or at


least you're just because of the wind


right she's we get it shielding her face


um the wind and the sand um


yeah so the wind picked up really


intensely right there and the sand


there's also rocks on this pavement here


we're in a parking


lot the wind pick up I had to turn my


body because I was getting pelted by


rocks so you can just imagine you know


what's


happening all right


okay we're going to go to Mike Rogers


now with some U updated information yeah


I want to go back to we're going to talk


about we did get Jasmine out of there


because it was just simply not safe for


her to be where she was but I want to


show you here uh and I'm going to break


down kind of the area that she was in


first of all I'm going to show you this


map first uh because this is the map


that shows kind of what's bur now this


has not been updated in a while uh and I


don't suspect that it might be for the


rest of the night because uh it is now


Nightfall and we have lost a lot of the


uh technology that is able to do that


but I just wanted to show you on a map


this is Palisades Charter High School


Jasmine was right in this area now what


I was telling you about before we went


to Jasmine there's a fire that is


burning in this area and what I'm


listening to is that has now become a


very significant operation for the fire


department because the building even


though they are under a mandatory


evacuation order is full of people so


what they're doing right now is they're


using a an air horn to try to tell


people to evacuate and get out of there


and at the same time they are trying to


go floor by floor and look at this I


want to show you on this Google uh


Google Map here uh how significantly


large this building is so this is what I


was telling you remember I told you it


sounded like that an ember may have hit


the roof and that's what started the


firewall this is that building this is


that very large building where that is


happening and right now it has become a


significant operation for lafd to try to


go floor by floor and evacuate this and


look at this as I come down into more of


a topography view look at the trees and


all the Shrubbery that are right here


and even up against this building which


just is making everything so much harder


for the fire Crews and so much more


difficult to try to keep fire away from


buildings like this because the shrubs


are so the shrubs and trees are so close


to it so this is a very active situation


that has become now a priority obviously


for the lafd and I'm listening to them


having to go floor by floor to try to


get people out they were trying to use


there's people in wheelchairs that I'm


hearing now are they're also trying to


get out so this has become a very hectic


and chaotic scene and it's right next to


where Jasmine was which is at Palisades


High School I also want our viewers to


know we've had a lot of people write in


and say hey has this place burned has


that place burned we're working on


getting all of that one viewer told us


that the bleachers here at palisad


Charter High School uh have had


structural damage somebody was concerned


for a church that I believe is just


further west on Sunset uh we're trying


to work on all of those things reach out


to the appropriate people involved as


you can understand it's a very chaotic


scene down there right now as you saw


from Jasmine's live pictures so that's


where things stand we're continuing to


monitor that apartment building fire


that is happening on Sunset it's the


15,500 block of Sunset Boulevard that


very large building that I just showed


you which as you're looking at my map is


in the mandatory evacuation Zone and it


is so critical that if you are in an


evacuation Zone that you get out people


in that building did not and now they're


finding themselves in a situation where


they're having to be rescued and the


fire department is trying to go through


and I'm listening to where exactly the


fire is it sounds like it's in the


corner of the building so look at though


I mean we have a significant chunk of


people that probably didn't think the


fire was going to make it as far as them


and that's here uh this is Charter High


School and Palisades Charter High School


that building is here but look all of


this area the Riviera country club is


under a mandatory evacuation tonight and


all of the people that live there


surround it will Roger State Beach where


the command post is is also in that


mandatory evacuation Zone I wouldn't be


surprised if we see that EV uh that


command post move yet again because of


now how significantly close the fire is


to where all of this was going on so we


can't cannot say it enough if you're in


an evacuation Zone you should listen to


that warning and you should leave


because we don't want is what's


happening in this apartment building


right now these people were under a


mandatory evacuation Zone they didn't


leave and now the fire department is


trying to rescue people out of this very


large building and you know what if even


if you're not in the exact evacuation


Zone if you're close to it yeah pay


attention you know and maybe you should


leave anyway you know even if you're not


directly affected at that time because


we have seen the wind shift and this


fire just spread since it broke out what


at 10:30 this morning and here we are at


547 so fast yes and and and just because


the fire is if you look out your window


and you don't immediately see it these


are more live pictures now of the fire


but the Embers that will shoot and cross


and jump and do all of those things just


because you are not necessarily right up


against the blaze doesn't mean that


those Embers aren't going to carry for


hundreds of feet thousands of feet even


uh and light something else on fire


everything is so dry out there and Mike


I believe this is our LAX camera that


we've pointed into the direction of


Pacific Palisades to to bring us these


pictures and you can see Wild what an


intense fire line how long it goes how


Smoky it is and again the worst of the


conditions the fire conditions are are


happening right now into the early


morning hours yeah and you can see the


camera bouncing around from the wind at


LAX as we look to the north you know we


talked about earlier today and just just


how dry we've been we haven't had a


significant rain since May but you know


when you you did a closeup of those


shrubs and Greenery surrounding some of


these structures you know that that's


still that's still fuel for fire may not


be as dry as some of the other


vegetation but you know in in this


particular instance you know our our


enemy is the wind right now because it's


driving these Flames the humidity is so


low that it doesn't matter necessarily


if it if it's Greenery or not that's


still going to going to catch fire and


that's what we have seen Happening Here


I think a lot of people people have been


surprised by the amount of structures


the amount of buildings but with a fire


as Fierce as that it doesn't matter this


picture you're looking at right now Mike


just want to say that's Jasmine leaving


the


area good to you can you hear me okay


yes yes you guys I'm trying I'm holding


the phone is my photographer Oliver is


driving down PCH we just came off to Meo


and it is unbelievable you guys right in


front of me Oliver maybe just stop for a


second here that I'm shooting through


the windshield so hold on let me get you


a better shot that is either an


apartment building or another home Up in


Flames there's debris all across the


road we're trying to avoid traffic cones


and trash cans that have been thrown


across people I've actually seen a line


of residents being let out by fire


trucks or I guess fire SUVs trying to


evacuate them maybe those who chose to


stay too long there are flames on on to


Mescal down to PCH and massive look at


this this is the building we're going to


inch past it


oh and you can feel the heat just


through the window as we got out of


there we just came off tocal yeah that's


that's it might be what Mike was talking


about the apartment no one Jaz yeah Jaz


you're on you're on PCH the one we were


talking about it's on Sunset so this is


a whole other building your GPS looks


like wow are you south of on PCH yeah we


just went well we went West on PCH but


we just came off to Mescal going back


through this intersection and the


visibility is horrible and you see what


we're dealing with cones and trash cans


all over is look this guy just swerved


around one wow as he's trying to get out


of here and that's that's the Pacific


Ocean you can't even see it it's just


Thick Smoke I mean Flames look at this


right along PCH and fire it is chaotic


fire trucks are going Every Witch Way


look at this massive


flame it just you know the more we see


Jasmine the further you get it just


seems like there're more


Flames yeah I don't I mean this guy just


did he hit someone oh oh they're trying


to avoid the


cone I mean there's just I don't know


how trash cans got in the middle of the


the PCH here but yeah there's a lot of


uh obstacles to avoid as not only


emergency vehicles but just trying to


get out of the way of the fire right and


that just makes it even well for


firefighters they can barely see in


front of them didn't smoke that heavy


that


thick yeah and you can't see I mean I


wouldn't even go up to mecco Canyon it


it that is I mean all those homes right


along that stretch look to be oh look to


be gone and you know we will hopefully


get an update um before the night is


over but you know hard to keep up with


numbers like that when it happens so


quickly mhm well we're so glad that


you're doing okay Jasmine now you can


barely make out yeah you can barely make


out the view right of Santa Monica we're


looking in the direction of Santa Monica


people y exactly where you're looking at


you know looks like you're getting into


more traffic or are people stopping


pulling over the side of the road ja


yeah this is looks to be where kind of


they're staging all the fire trucks now


is this fire has moved down off El medo


Avenue I mean I mean it's just crazy


this is where there were tons of the


cars lined up earlier you know a few


hours ago trying to get out of here and


now the fire has made its way all the


way down to PCH across to


mesco it it just the winds pushing these


Embers Every Witch Way but the fact that


it's moved this


far yeah yeah they're alling pull right


they're staging yeah they're staging all


over here I mean this is some heavy


equipment they're trying to bring in the


dozers to stop this fire from moving


even further right closer to Santa


Monica cuz you can see those lights in


the distance down there well that's


where a lot of people were were uh


evacuating too from what we heard even


some people started out on foot heading


towards Santa Monica you know go ahead


Jess oh I was gonna say yeah on foot on


bike we just passed a lady I hope she


got out of there I told you right right


when we had to leave she was on her bike


riding out with some bags on her back


well she's getting out any way she could


yeah you know another thing there are a


lot of there are some businesses


up and down PCH and I don't want to name


any um you know because I don't want to


mention something that that happens uh


not to be true but um you know there are


some familiar spots where people like to


like to dine and enjoy and iic you just


you know you just don't know um how


they're doing at this point so I said


even if you don't live in this area if


you do it's it's so sad and unfortunate


to watch but again this is impacting so


many people yep 10,000 residents 30,000


uh homes um in the area there businesses


as you mentioned Pat houses of worship


that have caught fire um as well oh


there's Jazz and now we see your face


Jazz oh


yeah so we we just came


to this must be to panga right on PCH as


emergency vehicles are uh heading up


that direction because the fire is


moving that direction as well as we saw


off to mecal it was just burning through


anything it could and these Embers were


flying everywhere and it's heartbreaking


to see that High School the football


field yeah we're going to be directed


through thank you gotcha


the they're turning on to panga they're


turning on TOA those fire trucks we saw


yeah we're right at


inada and trada Driver going to flip


around so let us go see cuz they're


worri that it's now it's going to jump


right if you're familiar so Patrick's


Roadhouse we're passing


uh State Beach liquor yeah


so chawa did I say that right chatt


chawa that's the boulevard


wherea sorry ch ch Chaka I can't even


speak with the great thank you smoke in


my and real quick I just where where she


was where we saw those that fire burning


I believe that was off toah heiti way it


looks like it's it's a row of um of of


homes that are right there that may have


been burning so it's she Jasmine came


off to Mescal uh and then was coming


Southbound on PCH it looked like near


Tahiti Shore Drive Driftwood Drive uh


Vista Terrace I think that's what she


was looking at when we saw all of those


uh all of those things on fire so it's


it's incredible out there and you know
