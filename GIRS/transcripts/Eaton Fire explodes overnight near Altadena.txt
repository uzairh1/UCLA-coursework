us and being out there for us.
Please stay safe and we'll check
in with you in just a little
bit. It's just extraordinary
that there's no water and you
just have to. Fire officials are
just helpless.
It's a it's a helpless
situation out there. Let's go on
to Coco McEvoy. She's in
Altadena and you can see that
van just burning behind you.
Yes. It's a really difficult
thing to see here in Altadena.
We really were trying to get to
another location, but we got
stopped because Lake Avenue
here, a lot of it is on fire.
We're at Lake Avenue and Mirada
Place and we're just showing you
some of the devastation that has
already unfolded here. Like you
said, a van completely engulfed
in flames, along with a portion
of this building here. But when
you go down the street as well,
you can see that there are homes
on fire in this neighborhood. A
lot of people have been fleeing.
I actually spoke to a family
before I got on air with you,
who was telling me they don't
even know where to go. They just
packed up their family. They
packed up their dog, and they
tried to get out as soon as
possible. We're walking here now
towards Lake Avenue because we
want to show you what's
happening here. There are
several emergency responders
that are now coming to this
area. Police officers, along
with fire crews as well.
You can see that right now.
There's a couple that's
driving into that neighborhood,
probably trying to check to see
if their home is okay. But as
we're here on Lake Avenue, you
can just see that there is a
structure there that is engulfed
in flames. Firefighters have
made their way to try to fight
the fire at that structure for
right now. But I can tell you,
even as we've been walking, it's
just constant. At one point,
it's one building on fire.
Firefighters are trying to fight
that fire, and another fire
starts immediately in the
opposite direction from where
they are. I can tell you, too,
that there are really embers
that are flying everywhere as
well. So definitely a dangerous
situation that right there is an
ambulance, so we're not sure if
anyone is inside of any of these
buildings or the homes that are
engulfed in flames. But there
are some people that are out
here. Some people are getting
video, some people wanted to
check on their homes because of
situation. But as we walk, it's
kind of like what I was telling
you. It just seems like more
fires seem to spark. Because now
right here, another fire has
started. So this is a situation
that's extremely difficult for
firefighters because, you know,
the resources are really
battle these winds also battle
the constant fires that are
burning. And it looks like that
might be some type of truck
that's on fire. I can't tell
right now because of the plume
of black smoke as well, but it's
just constant. A lot of fires
all around us and Coco.
So we were just with Gigi and
to access water, the fire
officials in that community, and
they're just having to stand
there helpless, watching these
structures burn. It looks like I
see water flowing down the
street. It looks like they seem
to have water out there. What's
the what's their water situation
like?
It does look like they seem
to have water here, at least at
the end of the street where they
are battling that fire, that
they're trying to get that one
under control. But like I said,
more keeps sparking. And I also
tell you that a lot of
explosions are happening as well
as I'm hearing in this area
because of what's burning.
Yeah, I'm hearing that. Coco.
I know it's disorienting where
you are, but I wonder if those
it's power lines, it seems like
there's a number of are those
apartment buildings or buildings
that are under construction, but
just big buildings in that area
thoroughfare?
That's that's exactly right
there. This building, for
example, right here, is under
construction. And there's also
what appeared to be a big truck
that burned that's now on fire.
I think from what we're seeing,
a lot of it is vehicles that are
exploding right now. But there
are also some houses that are on
fire as well, because the fire
continues to jump. But as you
see, this fire is really growing
rapidly here. So I'm sure that
fire crews, once they try to get
that structure just right next
to us under control, they will
probably end up moving to this
part of the fire as well. But a
lot of emergency crews are in
this area.
I'm looking at this gentleman
who's in the middle of the
street taking video, not
advised. Anybody who is in that
area just needs to get out of
the way and make room for fire
crews and first responders to be
able to do what they have to do,
because it seems like in your
where you are right now,
everything is on fire. Coco.
It's just spotting everywhere in
that neighborhood right now.
Exactly. It really is
important for people to evacuate
as soon as possible. I
understand that people are
trying to document, and they're
trying to make sure that their
homes are okay, but this really
is a very dangerous situation,
especially because a lot of
people that are out here do not
have fire equipment. So you got
to think about all the smoke
inhalation, the embers that are
flying. It really is important
for people to be as safe as
possible.
Thank you. Coco, for being
out there for us. Please take
care of yourself. If you feel
unsafe at any moment, get out of
there.
