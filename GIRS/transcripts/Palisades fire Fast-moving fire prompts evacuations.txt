e e e e yeah so this started as a vegetation fire this was in the 1100 block of North Pedra Mora drive and uh it has grown to like we said uh 20 acres at this point but likely to grow because of the powerful winds uh that the fire has to basically will it'll spread no question about that so Maria you mentioned there are homes above the fire we're obviously seeing the homes below the fire um many people in this area you you think about the fact that it's 11:15 in the morning some people probably not even home right and it's concerning they they went off to work and now they're going to have news that their home is essentially in danger yeah potential evacuation warnings according to the LA fire department right now and this y go ahead Maria no I was just going to say that these winds are not going to let up either uh so these winds are actually expected to strengthen even more as we get to the latter part of the afternoon and evening hours and overnight so the danger is going to be with us in terms of the red flag warnings and the extreme fire danger not just this in this area but everywhere but at the moment of course our focus is here on this fire and this is really threatening a lot of homes just to the south and north of this Palisades fire all right we think we have a shot from the the ground right here this is PCH looking um at Palisades from PCH and you can see the different perspective right there but uh a lot of homes in Jeopardy if this continues to spread as quickly as we've been watching it in the last few minutes or so this is exactly the scenario that fire officials have been warning people about even as early as yesterday morning that these dangerous wind conditions were going to come through and they were hoping praying uh the situation wouldn't happen but here we are watching this vegetation fire quickly spread it's being called the Palisades fire and we don't have uh exact acreage the last we heard is 20 but it could be much bigger now that doubled in just a few minutes from 10 acres when we first started reporting this at around 10:30 this morning yeah uh officials actually are predicting that the fire could grow to 200 acres in the next 20 minutes this is a tweet coming from Pepperdine University I'm looking at University officials uh of course monitoring the fire right now currently uh they're saying 20 acres but officials predicting it could go to 200 acres in the next 20 minutes or so as a result of the Winds pushing it from the Northeast toward the Pacific Ocean um at this point they're saying according to this we tweet it's not a threat to the Malibu campus there at Pepperdine University though obviously there is smoke uh filling the air air quality is going to be very poor on campus but um remember what happened not very long ago just a few weeks back where you did have um students who had to shelter in place the whole campus as a result of the Franklin fire pretty much locked down they were Sheltering in place they were looking out of big windows in their common areas and watching the wind just whip around the smoke and the Flames that were threatening the campus thankfully fire Crews during the Franklin fireworks able to keep that campus safe and secure you're taking a live look though at the aerial assets firefighters are using to try to keep this fire at Bay but clearly they need more and they need more help uh clearly also Maria the winds are going to be a challenge for these AAL assets right I'm wondering how much longer they can use those assets because I know in Fire's past when the wind was really whipping around they weren't able to use those fixed Wing aircraft they have a criteria and at the moment uh I'm not sure exactly what that figure is but right now they're still able to fly these winds are still ramping up as we get to the afternoon and evening hours so at the moment they are able to fly but when we're talking about these winds expecting to gust anywhere from 60 to 80 miles an hour in this area at the top of these ridges and the mountains of course the fire will create its own weather so we're getting the those variable winds however the prevailing winds are definitely coming out of the Northeast and they're very very strong this is what we were afraid of we were talking about and anticipating these strong winds and they're going to be staying with us through the day today um stay with us we're going to have more coverage on the Pacific Palisades fire right after this quick break e e e e e e e e about these strong Gusty winds that can carry Embers down several blocks even a mile or two so there's huge concern for all of those homes downwind of this fire as well as the the homes up North or above this fire fire tends to move even rapidly even more rapidly as it moves uphill because in essence it just preheats all of that fuel or that brush ahead of it and it just climbs all that much faster and we saw it just explode in in a half an hour from when it first started and this is the result of what's happening with the winds yeah it is spreading rapidly and quickly towards the ocean you've got hard closures it looks like uh of southbound PCH at toena Canyon Boulevard there structures are in fact threatened which is no surprise judging on what we're seeing and firefighters are on structure defense right now air resources are attempting to make those water drops um as we speak by the way there is um a report of another fire that's burning right now this is in the West Hollywood area it's called the sunset fire uh reported that there's an acre and a half burned so far it BR out in a building and then quickly spread uh near the Hollywood Hills adjacent to it spread to the the brush there and this happened very quickly what did you say it was about an acre and a half AC and a uh 20 units have been deployed uh so you know resources are going to be tight um and that is why we talked about this morning that um they were prepared for this and they were moving resources down to this area up from Northern California because they anticipated that this was something that was going to happen it wasn't a question of if it was a question of when and here we are you have two um Vantage points here that you see you've got the ground shot there on your right hand side of the screen and then you have the wider shot on your left hand side there uh very shaky obviously on the left-and side because of those winds but um wow that is uh that is some heavy heavy smoke okay we're going to take another break we'll be right right back and continue our coverage here e e e e see the response right there from the air and from the ground uh we have a number of videos that are coming in this is a shot I believe is this on the ground and then we have another one that we can see the the camera is static but it is it is very shaky because again the winds in that area are treacherous we've been talking about this even since yesterday MH they're saying 30 Acres now burned but they're expecting 200 acres to burn in the next hour so that's how quickly they are anticipating this to spread due to those high winds that we've been reporting and Maria's been talking about all morning long even to uh as early as yesterday those warnings coming out again let's look at some video that was sent to us here is some cell phone video you can see the wind gusts right there palm tree swaying and all of that smoke you could see the glow of the Flames as well the Vantage Point here from a neighborhood somebody recording cell phone video as they're traveling through some of these neighborhoods uh more downhill I guess you know not very close to the Santa Monica Mountain hillsides yet but you can see how far you can you can see it I'm sure you could smell it in the area as well but look at how strong those winds are cuz you could just take a look at the palm trees really swaying and just showing how strong those gusts are well also the contrast too when you can see um the smokiness and the greyness and the flames on one side right and then immediately right next next to it adjacent is a blue sky that just shows you how that wind is pushing in One Direction um it almost looks like on the left side of your screen it's nighttime mhm yeah you can see how threatened those homes are right now and this is even more so than we saw even when we started this this newscast just about what a half an hour ago we began with our coverage on this and the the fire at that point was 10 acres now it's 20 plus acres so it is exploding because of these Santa an winds which is exactly what we were afraid was was going to happen so I think on the left side of your screen right now we have a shot from is that LAX is that right okay so that's LAX right there you saw that plane taking off um the wind's also going to impact uh some flights of course as far as landing and takeoff is concerned as well not just at LAX but also in Burbank if you're flying out of Burbank um the areas with that are really of concern you've got the highways 118 one at the 210 Corridor the S Gabriel and Santa Susanna Santa Monica Mountains the foo Hills St Gabriel San Fernando valleys Pasadena Burbank San Fernando Hollywood Beverly Hills SEI Valley Porto ran Silmar Altadena lenta Malibu these are all areas that are in uh great danger and concern so you are encouraged to try to stay indoors and away from Windows if you find yourself in this um near this area obviously air quality is a big concern and you also should know that you should expect power outages at some point today that is going to be something that will impact residents if I named off some of those cities that I just named off Maria this is not confirmed right now but uh listening to a lot of radio chatter and radio traffic uh some officials are saying now approximately it is at about 200 acres and this fire is currently bumping that area of Chastain Parkway East and Cali Brittney um the Getty Villa right now is being threatened there are a lot of officials going to protect homes and structures there's a lot of homes here around this fire in this Canyon just to the south of this fire and to the north of that fire and I'm very concerned about spotting right now these winds are so very strong gusting between 60 to 80 mil an hour and with that close proximity of these homes these winds can carry Embers down not just blocks but by a mile or two and that's why there's great concern right now for all those homes all the way to the coast and the beach but even this this particular Red Flag Warning I I feel like was a bit more severe it's it's a rare January Red Flag Warning it is unusual to get it a little bit later in the season and you have to remember that this is the third driest start to the winter season that that we've had on record the last uh drier period before this was 2017 2018 the National Weather Service measured the moisture content for a lot of the brush that's out there there's a lot of vegetation here there's a lot of dry Fuel and when we get these strong winds that dries out the vegetation even more so they issued a PDS P potentially dangerous situation this is on the extreme level so you're right Jen and when we're talking about the extreme or the severity of the danger that was out there this particular Red Flag Warning was on the definite Higher Side uh when we can compare recent years we had a lot of vegetation That Grew over the last two Winters when we had a lot of rain so it can dry out very quickly with just a couple of periods of strong Gusty San Ana wind events and that's exactly what we had we had that one earlier this month in in December late November early December and it right out the vegetation and now we've got this this is compounding and this is going to continue through today in fact get stronger in terms of these winds this afternoon this evening through the overnight hours into tomorrow so the danger is going to stay with us so this is something interesting Maria I know I know that a number of aircraft were not allowed to fly because of President Biden being in in Southern California but we are just told that he's canceled his planned event today in SoCal because of the Winds and that he'll eventually give his uh remarks I think he was set to declare to National national monuments today so he'll be doing that virtually M that makes sense given the concern over the weather as well as now fire Crews battling this and uh the possible loss of structures and homes it is a devastating scene just to watch this play out on these live cameras right now but as those evacuation orders may be issued issued fairly quickly the county really wants to remind people of the checklist that's involved when you do have to evacuate quickly now is the time to gather everything you need the people pets important to you papers phone numbers and important documents there's a whole checklist here prescriptions vitamins and Eyeglasses pictures and irreplaceable memorabilia make sure you pack that all up also personal computer hard drives and discs and of course plastic so we're talking about credit debit cards and cash if you can gather those things they call it the six PS as you prepare to evacuate I'm talking to the areas that are all along that Ridge right there the Santa Monica Mountains because fire officials do say to be prepared to evacuate that evacuation order may take effect fairly quickly depending on where you're living so gather those things quickly hopefully you have a plan to get emergency notifications you can check on notify La as well but you can see those First Responders heading to the scene right there as more and more resources head to the scene we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with the very latest e e e e e okay so we have a resident of Pacific Palisades is this individual joining us on camera or over the phone oh there we go okay closer let's see thank you tell us your name and where you live uh good afternoon my name is Shawn Butler I live in Pacific Palisades at the corner of Sunset and uh muskingham and all I can tell you is that you know we're going to take extra precaution and get out early I got my dog and got what I could carry um sunset's already backed up and people are fighting and the only access Ingress and egress is T Mescal Canyon and Sunset Boulevard but I would strongly suggest that anyone who's close or involved in this download the watch Duty app watch Duty app it'll show you the fire the distance to your house where you are in terms of the fire it'll give you the number of people involved all the uh fire tankers the the planes and how many men on the ground um I'm concerned because like I told this gentleman this is my 9th Urban wildfire and when I saw it that close to my house I thought just better go and these are just the the start of the Winds they're going to get up to like 50 to 80 M hour if I read that right I hope not but I got my dog and you know hopes thoughts and prayers and you know do what you can but get out get your gold bag and get out don't underestimate estimate the ability of the fire to jump from house to house to house thank you you say tell us your name Sean Butler great and uh what other fires have you gone through in this area well I'm here because of the wolsley fire and you know I grew up in Malibu and so I've been through eight Urban wildfires and so I always have a bag packed I got my dog's medicine my medicine you know and uh what I what I can pack in my little car and and just leave the the rest up to the professionals the best thing I can do is get out of everybody's way and get down to this beach I'm currently staged at the huge empty parking lot on tascal Canyon and and PCH I would suggest anybody who wants to meet people would come down here and meet their loved ones here because there's lots of access thank you sir did you get any of that this uh gentleman obviously is very well prepared he's very well experienced he's gone through many fires he he talked about how he's prepared to go he has his dog he has his um medication his paperwork that sort of thing um and his home is it appears to be In Harm's Way so he's uh thinking ahead and doing exactly what uh fire officials and authorities hope that people do do getting out of the way he said I'm getting out of the way so they can do their job which is perhaps the best thing you can do also he did mention the watch Duty Wildfire map and alert it's an app that you can get where it can basically give you information as far as how far the fire is the proximity of it the logistics the location so maybe that's something you can download or uh pass that information on to others who may be impacted by this fire and we're also hearing unconfirmed reports right now that homes are burning on lockman Lane um again this is something that hasn't been confirmed through officials but uh they requesting additional resources there and we know that this fire has grown now to 200 acres in the last 20 minutes yes wow yes um according to that app which have been mentioning uh this morning there's now according to the radio chatter there's a fire that's been spotted across Palisades Drive which is on both sides of the road this is just North of where the fire started so that fire is kind of in that can in between where the village is at if you're familiar with the Pacific Palisades area there's that area kind of near the village and St Matthews and then you go up lochman lane to that upper part and that's where Palisades Drive is at and there are reports of several structures that are on fire off lockman and off Palisades Drive so yes just echoing what you said about having that Ready set go and being ready to evacuate if you're in that area yeah and the importance of going now going early while you can because as that Resident was mentioning already traffic is backed up along Sunset and the only free area he was saying is tuscal Canyon but soon as residents start to evacuate try to get out of the area that those areas are going to be backed up not to mention this broke out at around 10:30 this fire and so if there are any residents that were at at work and not home and now trying to get back home to perhaps collect their belongings or their pets or loved ones that's a situation as well that First Responders don't want to deal with people trying to get to this area to get into their homes that might be threatened so you have both situations here people trying to get out people trying to get into the area and that's just going to create a traffic nightmare well already fire units are having a hard time coming up palade to drive because of the traffic and the evacuations I'm reading and what you're looking at just so you're aware you have the live video um on the left side of your screen this is happening as we speak right now on the ground we have our photographer there on the right side you have video from a little bit earlier again we started um hearing about this about 10:30 in the morning so uh we're an hour over an hour in here hour 15 it was 20 acres only but it has grown to 200 acres and and what's really disturbing is that we haven't even hit the peak of the Winds quite yet right those winds are really going to pick up we're we're CL we're clocking them in in at what 40 mph Maria but that's just the beginning yeah that's just sustained winds we're talking about the wind gusts up at that higher elevation nearing 60 to 80 M an hour and as you mentioned this is not even the peak of the Winds this is uh right now where it's just starting to ramp up and I'm hopeful because I'm still seeing those fixed Wing aircraft flying in some of the helicopters but as these winds are expected to really strengthen later this evening uh I'm not so sure they're going to be allowed to keep flying so it's really CR IAL these next uh couple of hours on what they do to attack this fire and it's critical what you do uh if you are living in and around this area uh please maybe yes evacuate early before you're told to go and uh prepare uh for this the evacuation orders have been requested for this area uh down the Pacific Coast Highway per the radio traffic but the exact parameters at this point it looks like they haven't uh released that information but as you mentioned earlier it is a disturbing detail that Palisades Drive on both sides of the road there is that fire being spotted and as you mentioned because of the wind the Embers are flying around and that's when you get these spot fires right popping up all over the place yeah we talk about that and how the winds can carry these Embers uh a couple miles down the road not just blocks but really fires down even to the coast there was some chatter about perhaps The Villa or the Getty Villa was uh in danger but it's a large part uh downwind of that fire all the way the coast but also to the north of the fire it's important to note that this fire you know it burns quicker as it goes uphill and uh there's a lot of vegetation in this area so there's a lot of fuel for this fire to burn and yeah we're also being told there is absolute gridlock on Palisades Drive and that people are driving along down both sides of the road so that's also something to look out for for sure you want to be safe and careful when you're driving in that area and making sure that fire Crews can get there and get to where they need to be but look at that shot there on the right hand side it almost looks like nighttime that smoke is so thick and so close to some of the homes there yeah it really shows you how dramatic a fire can be especially with these whipping winds at one moment it can change in an instant and having covered Fires for so many years when you're in the thick of it like that it can turn from day to night seemingly because of the smoke and the situation with the winds just whipping things around covering the sky and covering the sun it is very dramatic and and and frightening frankly for the people on the ground there the homes that are being threatened and hopefully a lot of the residents that we've spoken to it seems like they're kind of in a situation where they've lived with this threat for a while so many people are prepared preped they do have a plan they do have a go bag but hopefully that is the situation today given the warning especially that fire officials emergency responders and all of us on the news have been saying for quite some time starting yesterday morning that this was going to be a dramatic weather event today these dangerous wind gusts and these windstorms you could take a look at these two people standing on the ridge line right there just to give you a perspective of the enormous of that plume of smoke and that's billowing in the sky that we've been looking at and just to show you the enormity of and the sense of size that we're talking about right here more than 200 Acres burned already in in a matter of minutes really you know looking at this for just over an hour now um this vegetation fire that broke out around 10:30 and now just difficult to get a handle on because of the high winds we have been watching these six wind aircrafts doing some aerial drops but clearly I mean look at how dangerously close it's come to those uh structures the homes right there that we're looking at from the vantage point of PCH at this point um I video of okay we're looking at an aerial drop right here and look at how shaky the camera is because of the Winds that's what we're talking about and how hard hard it is for these First Responders to really tackle this of course they've been trained and they know what they're doing but clearly the winds are going to be posing a challenge as they just get more gusts coming throughout the the afternoon we know the evacuation orders have been requested for that that fire area all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway uh and the fire we know has been spotted across Palisades Drive so it it definitely jumped both sides of the road and this is uh just from the radio traffic that we're Gathering right now and um a reminder if you don't have the watch Duty app or you can even pull this information up online it's very helpful uh you're looking at it right now if you pull this information up there you will see it shows you where the fire is and then if you click on that fire icon there you get a ton of information on you know what needs to be done what's being recommended as far as evacuation zones are concerned so it is a very useful tool to have um to share with other people who may be in this area or who may be at risk of having this fire spread to their location you can uh download the app or just pull this information up online watch Duty right there you could also make sure to follow notify LA because that is where you're going to get your emergency notifications as well as uh local authorities straight from uh lafd and LA County fire there's a number of resources where you can find out the information you're looking for and that you need lafd.org SL alerts it'll give you a quick uh evacuation checklist as these evacuation orders take effect you want to make sure you bring along all the important Necessities that you need to make sure you stay safe and protected and there's also notify La for emergency alerts as well as ready La um for the Emergency Management Department all important resources for the community right there and of course uh we'll bring you all the information uh as we know it and get it into our Newsroom but giving you the vantage point of two locations right here the ground shot this is just off of tuscal Canyon PCH that is where a lot of residents say that they will be going because look at the space in the parking lot we have Tony bout I believe our photographer there on the ground showing us as he pushes in uh on that ground shot but clearly the issue is traffic as we saw gridlock on PCH I believe or Palisades Boulevard as well as sunset according to some residents there and traffic is just getting backed up because of residents coming and going from the area either evacuating or trying to get back into the location to uh check on their belongings and and get out so we want to make sure those roads are open to make sure that first respond responders can make their way back and forth again with the red flag warning in effect there are parking rules also that are in effect not just here but in locations all across the Southland with this uh dangerous wind warnings right because when there is a Red Flag Warning parking restrictions are in place and that's to make sure especially along these Canyon communities these Canyon roads to make sure people aren't backing up and clogging these roads that could potentially be a high-risk area when it comes to fire danger yeah and and so I mean sandre you can see how close that that fire and that smoke has really gotten to some of the homes that are being threatened in that area even since we started broadcasting uh just about just before 11:00 this fire broke out at around 10:30 looking at fixed wi aircraft I believe these are sea planes that are uh scooping up the water from the ocean and then dropping it onto some of the the structures and and the the vegetation that this fire was able to pick up but you're talking about uh winds Maria 60 to 80 miles per hour gusts in that area these are just horrific conditions for a fire to have broken out yeah right now the winds are not even at their Peak so they're going to get stronger as we get into the evening and overnight hours I do want to just quickly read a tweet that uh our point of contact at fire here Eric Scott he has just tweeted that there is indeed uh they updated the number to 200 acres and and growing the fire is burning Westward near the Pacific Palisades Highlands Community with Rustic Canyon just to the East and then Topanga Canyon to the West this is uh they are all under that evacuation warning the news media uh they're all Gathering and meeting with lfd and the pios right now are the the officers in in involved at the Will Rogers State Beach command post so that's where we're going to get an update from them momentarily hopefully but 200 acres plus now burning Westward near that Pacific Palisades Highlands Community with Rustic Canyon to the east Tanga Canyon to the west and you are all under that evacuation warning uh be safe out there as you are heading out I'm seeing people walking with their dogs you can see that one gentleman's walking his dog up there and people are just kind of like up there just to get a look an up close look at the fire not recommended at all you heard that guy who had been living through I think he said nine separate fires that were in that area including the woy fire and he said the first thing that he thought to do when he saw the smoke especially in a day like this is to grab all of his personal belongings anything that he could and to get out and that's exactly what he did and we do have an emergency alert coming in right now this emergency message coming from the LA County fire department and there is an evacuation order issued for Sunset Messa area you see those alerts coming through your phones right there they are saying leave now evacuation order issued for the sunset Mesa area leave now so follow those instructions from emergency Personnel they want you to leave right now so that means no time to pack up and do all the things you should have done that already leave immediately and again evacuation order in place for that area so time is of the essence when it comes to emergency situations like this clearly and now you have emergency Personnel they don't want to fight this dramatic fire and then look at the fixed Wing aircraft Sandra that we're looking at right now it's it's the wings are are kind of rocking back and forth because of how high the winds are and you can see how close they are to uh the property right there it is so low and they're trying to get that exact precision and the drop to really battle this Blaze as best they can but clearly again to the point of these evacuation or ERS there comes a time where you have to leave and the last thing First Responders want to do is go back and try to help you while while they're trying to get everyone else to leave and then also fight the fire so please listen to These Warnings let's go right now to Captain Eric Scott who has uh been such a wealth of information for us uh throughout the years you could tell us right now what we're looking at and what the situation is Captain well what we have is a 200 acre Fast Wind driven fire in Pacific Palisades it's particularly affecting the Pacific Palisades Highlands Community so if you're looking at a map you would see toena Boulevard that's going to be to the west and Rustic Canyon to the East and so anywhere in between that is an evacuation warning right now so that means you should know your Ready set go program and you should absolutely be in the set portion that means grab your predetermined belongings that are important to you and your family back your vehicle in the driveway and get ready to leave we actually encourage you to leave right now if you're able to uh and we're want you to expect some evacuation orders to be coming shortly what can you tell us in terms of any structures that have burned or damaged right now we don't have an estimate on that um you know with this significant wind event we've had countless meetings and pre-employ additional resources uh in these areas just in case a fire would break out so we could hit it as hard and as fast as we can and that's what we did but we knew if we couldn't catch it in 20 minutes that it's going to go to hundreds plus acres and that's exactly what's transpiring so now is the time period that we want people to uh start to leave that area a lot of those folks are evacuating by by foot that I'm watching walk down the streets and um we want them to start to to uh enact their Ready set go program okay Captain Eric Scott thank you uh stay with us I just want to welcome our viewers if they're just joining us we're extending our coverage of course uh because of this fire this fire that has spread so quickly you mentioned 200 Acres have burned thus far and likely of course that is going to get much higher as a result of the Winds at 10:30 it was just a 20 acres and it didn't take long for us to reach 200 Acres uh correct yeah it is very rapidly moving it's not you know a lot of people are lowed to sleep right now because it's perhaps cool out and they think it's not Wildfire season but that absolutely is not the case it's the wind that is the significant driver and we have some of the most powerful winds Southern California is going to see in Los Angeles and Ventura counties since 2011 and captain we're taking a live look at the aerial view of this massive fire right now as well as a ground shot we are seeing some fixed Wing aircraft making those aerial drops what are we talking about in terms of the situation that they're facing how difficult is it for these aerial assets to really attack this fire given the wind it's definitely a challenge uh we immediately got um our helicopters up we have um a bell 205 and they were able to get up overhead and I'll show us where the fire was where it's going and that assisted deploying waves of additional firefighters into the key location so um air assets are difficult um when you have such significant strong wind but uh in all sincerity we have the best Pilots out there and and we're really proud of their work today Captain there are some there's some chatter on online uh I don't know how confirmed this is but some people taking refuge in their swimming pools in these communities because they're concerned about the fire and it's close to them have you heard anything about this and do you have anything to say uh about this type of a reaction you know first off we understand that people want to try to save and protect their home uh now's not the time to do that when you have such a a rapid wind driven fire your your garden hose or pool pumps are not going to have any significant uh GPM to to make a difference and what we're going to have to do is then reallocate resources to save life when right now we'd like to just be able to worry about property so uh we want people to to stay tuned and we're going to provide some more uh information of where the fire is going and and get people out ahead of it but um you know staying at your home um is not a wise course of action however a swimming pool is a safe refuge in the event you cannot Escape and you have uh impeding fire upon you or if your house is burning then that is the time to look at a up swimming pool thank you that's actually quite helpful um there is that watch Duty app where people can follow along and get updated information as far as the acreage that's burned thus far evacuation orders uh where they can go the proximity of the fire are there any other resources you encourage people to follow we're setting up um a full command post at Will Rogers Beach and an the emergency Operation Center with uh including a joint information center to keep people informed in Downtown LA so you could look to uh lafd on um Twitter lafd.org um for updates we're working on providing more information on there lafd.org Wildfire for a lot of uh good overall information for instance we always tell people to keep the six PS of evacuation um so that's in case of an immediate evacuation is required which is what we're looking at here we want you to grab your peas that's the people and pets as one then it's think of papers any phone numbers important documents uh the third thing is prescriptions think of your vitamins your eyeglasses the fourth is what pictures essentially any ill replaceable memorabilia that your family has five is your personal computer or laptop and lastly six is plastic so think of like your credit cards ATM cards and cash you should have already had everything predetermined that you want Now's the Time to take that predetermined plan put it into action absolutely action is the key to make sure you get ahead of this thank you so much Captain Eric Scott for your time and invaluable information uh this is really necessary for the communities there enduring this threat of the Wildfire we'll check back in with you later I know you're very busy and uh can get the very latest in terms of information for us uh as this progresses so thank you so much Captain pleasure ma'am take care be safe all right let's now go to Matthew seedorf who is live on the ground there uh near the area where he can give us a different perspective Matthew what are you seeing well right now we're on West Sunset Boulevard in the Palisades area and it is just a traffic grid lock we see emergency crews trying to get through the traffic and just a large plume of smoke uh we just got that evacuation order on our cell phones and it seems like a lot of other people in the area did as well um so the traffic out here right now is just horrible as you know a lot of families are trying to evacuate we've got we see school buses and again just that big plume of smoke in the air very ominous situation are you seeing people evacuate away from the area that's causing the grid lock are you seeing some people trying to get in too cuz that's usually the situation when it comes to something like this especially a fire that breaks out while people are already at work or school they've left their homes already for the day and now they're under threat yeah we're driving towards the fire and it is just absolutely gridlocked no one's moving and then there's the other situation too where emergency First Responders are trying to get through and it's so gridlocked that it's just it's a hard situation for everyone to get towards the fire right now okay is this your video on the left I I believe the the traffic wow this is the situation we're looking at that was on PCH going towards the Pacific palisad um probably about 15 minutes ago and you can see even on PCH it's also backing up pretty far and then you can see possibly an ambulance trying to go on the wrong side of the road with the lights and sirens on just trying to get there as fast as possible but yeah traffic is a huge problem right now so is that just past the California incline the video that you took uh going up PCH yes that's correct yeah wow all the way down here and this this is the situation they're talking about you know be prepared to leave have all your items packed knowing that this was going to be a severe and devastating Windstorm that was going to impact this area and unfortunately now residents are trying to go back into this Zone to get their belongings yes absolutely if you can I it's very hard to say I know when you're you're G being given this advice and it's your home and your belong ings and your property that's in danger initially that's what you want to do is go towards that but your life is not replaceable so that that is the direction you should not head you should be going the opposite way the gridlock on Pacific uh PCH obviously is going to be an issue Pacific Palisades Drive already seeing a ton of traffic you have uh First Responders obviously trying to make make their way into these areas so you want to clear up the roadway uh for them um there you see some police cruisers quickly race towards the danger zone we did speak to a gentleman who uh perhaps gave the best advice and he'd been through several wildfires he said up to nine I believe he said this is my ninth one that I'm dealing with and he said my goal is to just stay out of the way he already had his things and had moved out of the way and if that's something you can do that would be a tremendous help to these First Responders um so where are you exactly right now just describe to us one more time what you're experiencing and seeing yeah well on West Sunset Boulevard I'm trying to get another video out on on Twitter of just how bad the traffic is right now uh towards being being be Avenue um just the traffic is so bad and it's just a a scary situation because you can see the smoke uh just getting closer the wind is picking up and then just the First Responders uh trying to get to this fire to help put it out are having a hard time getting there because the traffic is so bad we did get that evacuation order with the alarm uh on our phones and we've been getting it a couple of times now and it says evacuate now evacuate immediately um just emphasizing the danger of this situation um and like you've been touching on just's a lot of these people going towards the fire right now likely trying to get their belongings and stuff as this fire gets closer yeah we should say fire officials are saying that the evacuation warnings in place right now span from Tanga Canyon on the west to Rustic Canyon on the East and crews are the on the scene requesting evacuation stretching to PCH so uh there you have it and we want to make sure that people can get out of Harm's Way listen to the evacuation warnings and orders in effect right now there are confirmed reports of structures that are damaged as well as homes that are damaged but unconfirmed as to where specifically those homes and structures are but in fact we do have confirmation from fire officials that property has been damaged in all this and hopefully uh things won't get worse but we're not looking at a good scene right now with all of the wind gusts that fire crews are dealing with and and the amount of time the quick amount of time this fire has spread and doubled in size is just so dramatic at this point and remember uh as Maria's been saying you know this is uh kind of the beginning in in in the sense that the winds aren't as strong as they're going to get right we we are talking about 40 m per hour winds at this point but Maria you said that's obviously going to reach much higher we're definitely expecting these winds according to the computer models and according to the weather Dynamics in place this is just the beginning we're expecting these winds uh to increase as we get to the evening and overnight hours uh this is the time this is the window I think that firefighters have in order to continue to fly these fixed wi aircraft I know they brought in a lot of resources from the north to handle a situation like this should it occur and this is exactly what happened so this is the critical moment as our um you know fire captain uh Scott was was mentioning so you really have to stay alert during this time not just in this area but there is a wide widespread Red Flag Warning that's in effect not just for the Pacific Palisades area but up and down the coast down through parts of Orange County in the Inland Empire so under these weather conditions the smallest spark can cause a fire and it can grow exponentially it can explode under these weather conditions wind is the most com important component in allowing the fire to spread and this is exactly what happened today so stay vigilant please stay alert and have that ready set go plan in place hopefully you have had it in place and uh you're listening closely to the reports all right so we want to let people know what they're looking at on the screen right here so on the leftand side this is live footage right now if I can actually get um a locator on this video where are we exactly we're looking at cars leaving what what tocal Canyon Canyon and Pacific palisad that's a vantage point you're looking at on the left right and this is a bigger a wider shot of that um so you're looking at that Hillside burning look at the charred debris below and that fire active fully engulfed right um so you were looking at lots of vehicles making their way out of that area on the right hand side is video from not that long ago but it is um not a live look it's just showing you it is a live shop at this point yes we're looking at on the right as well um so we both the these are both live videos then okay so there you see the vehicles uh fire trucks making their way up that Hillside oh lots of resources you can sense the urgency there and the fact that schools have been closed down uh there were red flag warnings in effect red flag parking restrictions in effect as well these are Canyon areas that are known and prone for these fire fire hazards like this and then when something comes up you want to make sure that those roads are clear for exactly that reason as you saw there three rigs racing up the hillside to try to battle this Blaze and they need those roads clear to be able to make their way to the fire so clearly you you just saw firsthand why that's so important you're going to smell that smoke too I imagine ma Matthew if you're still on with us I don't know if you can hear us but are you there yeah I hear you okay if you can talk about I mean that you look at we're just looking at the footage obviously we're in the studio but where you are I imagine you're smelling that smoke uh actually I've not seen the I'm not smelling the smoke but we are seeing the flames right now we're just getting on to Los lus Avenue uh by Oreo place um the fire you can see it just from the homes and a lot of people are outside watching it right now um as it's growing just some we see some thick black smoke and the big Flames up on the hill as we try to get closer but yeah just the the traffic overall in the area is a real problem problem we see people on this road where we're on packing up uh putting their belongings in their bags as the Flames are getting uh dangerously close very intense that's interesting that you're not smelling the smoke uh I I had to just assumed that you would but that's good that's good that uh the air quality is okay where you are um Maria people who have asthma or any kind of upper respiratory issue you definitely want to stay indoors if you're anywhere near this area of course you're listening to the evacuation orders um if you're not familiar with this Pacific Palisades area there's kind of a mix of homes here there are beautiful multi-million dollar homes and then you have you know the the regular homes but this is a very desirable area to live there are amazing sweeping views of the ocean from up here uh where the fire is located it's kind of in between it's in a canyon that's in between a really populated area of Pacific Palisades there's the village and you can see from this vantage point it goes all the way down to the beach you've got the upper Mesa area and off of uh Palisades Drive uh lochman Lane there's that whole area up there just to the north of the fire so there's a lot of people that live in that area there are schools I think P high is not too far from from there so I know a lot of parents may be trying to get up to where their kids are but hopefully you have had that plan in place with what your family is going to do in cases like this today so evacuation now from the area of Pacific Palisades those not in the evacuation area should shelter in place that is what the lafd is putting out on social media um there are maps um that they are providing for you to follow if you follow LA City emergency Mercy alerts you will have access to the maps and the information that's LA City emergency alerts another um helpful tool is that watch Duty app if you can download that or even just find it online you can get up to the minute information as far as acreage that's burned your proximity your location evacuation um suggestions and warnings that are being put out by the minute radio traffic is indicating that traffic on palisad Drive is in fact gridlocked which is what we've been talking about and you know what now we're seeing according to the watch Duty app that cars are being abandoned by people which uh is making it very tough for actually firefighters and firefighting Vehicles who are trying to make their way up to this danger zone if you're abandoning your vehicle that makes it quite tough obviously firefighters are requesting that people at the top of palisad Drive shelter in place at this point so look at that yeah that is that is very messy you can see how backed up traffic is along our live look right here at PCH along the coast right there and frustrated residents are just parking their cars and leaving their cars and that's creating a gridlock for a lot of people who obviously need to get through we know that the East B to PCH is closed at tapena so that's another area you want to avoid as well but please just heed the warnings and listen to the evacuation orders in place uh evacuation warnings as well or a shelter in place situation like aoxy was saying so there are certain orders for each Community or depending on where you live and those are so necessary to follow because First Responders are trying to get to you they're trying to get to this fire to make sure that they can protect life and property that is their main goal and they can't do it without your cooperation and without your help and that means try to C keep the area clear of traffic don't abandon your cars on the streets make sure those arteries and major thoroughfares are open for First Responders to get through and to make sure that if you're out of the area don't try to get back in to get that piece of paper you need you know you need to get out and and be safe uh nothing is more important than your life so property is replaceable as hard as that is to uh you know accept but your life is not I think we have some our director just said we have some new videos so let's see what we have I'm the this is Pacific Palace there you hear our photographer Amanda Hernandez saying to mesco and Pacific Palisades Drive that's the traffic you're looking at on the right hand side of your screen just the amount of traffic of people trying to get out and get in and you can see the fire line right there along the ridge side of the Santa Monica Mountains that's what they're trying to battle and uh try to keep at Bay trying to protect these homes if they can well with the footage with the with the image that we have um if we can go back to a wider shot you it's interesting because yes you're seeing Vehicles trying to make their way out but you're also seeing the opposite you're seeing Vehicles trying to make their way in and we're not talking about just uh fire trucks and um you know rescue Personnel we're talking about regular Vehicles civilian Vehicles so we're seeing traffic both ways um which actually isn't a good sign there we go there we see more fire trucks that looks like previous video this previous video right on the right of these going up the hill right now so yeah that was I'm thinking I'm having deju here but yes that is video from not very long ago where you saw those fire trucks racing up towards where they need to be and you're seeing Vehicles trying to make their way back but that was um an interesting development that the uh watch Duty app released where they were saying that there is gridlock on Pacific drive and cars are in fact being abandoned by people making it really tough for firefighting operations so um I'm not quite sure why people are abandoning their vehicles maybe it's Panic maybe they feel like they can't get out and they need to and they're just saying okay I'm going to walk I'm going to leave my car here but that's really creating a problem if you feel I guess the need to do that uh I would say try to at least pull over right at least give some Pathway to those fire trucks and uh police Personnel so they can make their way in and you're looking at tasal Canyon right there in PCH it looks like they are shutting down that area into the community towards the fire so if you're going towards your home that is perhaps under threat or in the evacuation zones it looks like police are right there to check your identification perhaps or to turn you around because the last thing they need is more gridlock and more people on the streets around that area as far who's try to battle this Blaze so right there you're seeing a road closure a road stop uh identification check perhaps and look at this dramatic scene right here as we take another live look from this ground perspective you see the Flames getting closer to the homes right there and so this is what we're talking about what First Responders do need to tackle are those Flames not the people that want to come in and out of the area so again very dramatic scenes right here as the flame looks like it's encroaching on the property line right there in terms of this Vantage Point we've been looking at but this looks much worse on the left hand side of your screen than we saw a couple minutes ago and then again on the right hand side of your screen you are seeing those fixed Wing aircrafts making those water drop this is a good sign obviously that means that they are able to continue to attack the fire from above that the winds aren't so dramatic that they are not able to do this cuz we do know that in the overnight hours and when the wind gets too dangerous they do have to stop some of these aerial drops from time to time but at this point the wind gusts aren't as bad where they are allowing these fix Wing aircraft to make these drops and it's certainly a welcome site because they do have a lot of work ahead of them with more than 200 Acres burned at this point I'm sure that number has grown over the past half hour or so but clearly you can see all those homes in Jeopardy and you don't want those Flames to spread um I do really really quickly want to just let you know evacuation Center is available at Westwood Recreation Center this is evacuation Center at Westwood Recreation Center I just Google the address that's at 1350 South oful Boulevard so if you can get to Westwood Recreation Center at 1350 South uh subul Boulevard that is an area that um is welcoming people if you need to get out of Harm's Way Maria I see you standing there is there some information about they often will go to Westwood and use that as sort of the the ground or the base for the evacuees so you can get to Westwood if you can get there that's here on the West Side just off of Wilshire between really Santa Monica and Wilshire is the Westwood recreation center and that is providing uh some shelter for you if you are evacuated okay that's good uh that is good information to have um let's see we yes with whom we're going to try to speak to Tony boutta right our photographer there okay wonderful okay Tony hey Tony it's a Roxy and Sandra um tell us where you are and fill us in on some information you have where you are hey guys uh here at that's Will Roger State Beach which uh I understand the command post is going to be set up here um so far as far as air quality here you can see the smoke is blowing out the sea so it's actually not Smoky at this location so this will be a great spot for their command post the only uh air assets I've seen um actually making drop so far have been the super scoopers that are Unleashed from uh Canada and I did see some uh some big vlat hel tankers fly through the smoke I from my vantage point can't see where they're dropping uh but we still have lots of Emergency Equipment coming and so far uh Pacific Co back up slightly but you can see lots of police uh command posts coming in uh I showed you guys earlier at tuscco Canyon there they blocked traffic finally trying to alleviate some of that so it's just now like uh what maybe 2 hours into this fire finally starting to back up PCH Tony you're the camera to our right right where you're showing us this parking lot right here um from when you got there to now it looks like there's a ton of vacancy right there's not many people who are there right now yeah it's uh you know it's not a summer day so the uh parking lot was pretty empty matter of fact the the parking guy uh didn't want to let us in even though uh we got this big emergency going on so I had to park far away and uh and walk up here and now some of my colleagues are starting to show up and uh this is where the command post is going to be eventually so it's this parking lots about to get very busy yeah that's right we talked to Captain Eric Scott who did say that Will Rogers was the place where they're going to disseminate and give out all the information that command post is going to be set up there it doesn't even look like they've set up yet which indicates that it's probably difficult for them to get the resources they need to that location at this point people are busy figh fighting this fire doing the work that they have to do first before they can give the information out correct and also just to get to that point because of all the traffic backup perhaps so so again you're looking at uh the aerial view right there of uh super scooper Tony great shot of them doing their work and and the wind gust Tony how what's the wind situation like where you are it comes and goes right now it is uh great you can kind of see the smoke is going straight up again when I first got here it was blowing hard out to sea yeah which it's still uh if you look down the coastline you can still see it's getting pretty Smoky down there but uh if you look at these trees right here it really uh the wind is not too bad right now but then all of a sudden we'll get a big gust out of nowhere yeah I I imagine for so many people who have lived through so many fires in this area this does look reminiscent of the woy fire I remember being there along that beach on PCH when the wind gusts and and the plume of smoke was blowing that way towards the sea it is difficult to see this and and watch when you remember the devastation of the woy fire but clearly we're hoping for the best in this situation and we are seeing that they are battling this uh you're this shot is amazing Tony these looky L along the hillside right there Maria's here too and watching this all happen and watching the smoke come over the ridge there are homes nearby so they're probably you know looking hey Tony it's Maria here I know that you've covered so many of these your volunteer uh you know official search and rescue when we talk about these winds which clearly the fixed Wing aircraft are still able to fly do you know what that criteria is because we are expecting the winds to increase later this evening and overnight but do you know what the criteria is when they are not allowed to fly at some point I don't know that they have a specific mil per hour it's more if the uh the people in charge of the aerial attack yeah they'll decide I know for a fact that the ones that will be shut down first will be these uh super scoopers they uh do not do very well in high wind uh this spot where they're at now is perfect for them cuz we're right next to the ocean it's a little hard for them to pick up when the ocean's rough but so far it's not too bad you don't see any big white caps out there so they're able to go out and return quickly where all those other uh Vats and uh other ones dropping fosu they have a long return time they got to go all the way to an airport somewhere and be reloaded and then fly back out here where these guys are making great work they're just constantly you know non-stop since I got here they've made I don't know hundreds of drops already yeah wow that's yeah and it's you know you could probably see him here as he comes down and it'll just drag on the ocean and that I want to say they pick up over 3,000 gallons I believe it's amazing what they're doing and and the work that they're doing so quickly to battle this Blaze all right Tony thank you so much please stand by because right now we are going let's let's just watch this for a moment though because this is pretty uh incredible how quickly all that water was gathered right and they're going to just go right back up that hill yeah and and and the Precision and the experience that these Pilots these firefighter Pilots have it's really incredible what conditions they're fighting against right now they're able to fly despite the wind gusts up at that high elevation nearing 60 MPH so this is really incredible work that they're doing I'm so grateful for them to be here right now let's watch this action um this the logistics of the location really ideal if you could even say that yeah here we go near the ocean Maria how um at one point I guess how strong would those winds be for them to be unable to do this well if I remember correctly you know when we were um covering that fire earlier in the month of December there was a time where they were not allowed to fly because those winds were really nearing 100 miles an hour in terms of those gusts we're not quite there yet but they are expected to strengthen for the rest of the day all right thank you for that we're going to go to Armando our photographer who actually has a neighbor there uh Armando hi uh oh he can hear us hi sir okay what's the situation you're facing right now and where are you well I live across the street from where the fire is I can't get there uh and I'm in contact with my neighbor we were told to Evac I wasn't there at the time we were told to evacuate uh although I just she just called me and the uh instructions are conflicting it's uh that that's actually been the case all along La FD has a couple of different sites and they conflict with each other on whether we should act EV evacuate or not we had a little tiny fire a couple of weeks ago and the same thing was true there um uh it's uh it's across Palisades Drive Palisades drives about 100 ft wide uh and I imagine and the wind was blowing favorably but it's changing back and forth according to my neighbor so we don't we don't know what's going to happen sir we didn't get your name I apologize what's your name Fred Frankle Fred uh thank you Fred for taking the time to talk to us so you left the your home this morning and then you got word of what was happening and you're unable to go back and you're getting updates from your neighbor is that correct th that is correct my next door neighbor and is your next door neighbor uh staying in place have they been told they need to leave what is the situation well that's what they were telling me some of the sites say leave some of the sites say no so la has a couple of different sites and they don't always agree with each other uh the text we're getting the text I got says evacuate now uh on my phone and my daughter's at school and she's also told you know they don't know where she is but she was told on her phone to evacuate is she in but so far is she in high school what what school does she go to yeah high school high school okay uh Gein Academy well I think if in doubt and you're in the area you should leave uh obviously if you're getting these alerts well yeah and please stay off the road the fire uh there's going to be a this is a big fire this is way bigger than we've seen before uh the smoke is really dark and there's a lot of it and uh you know I'd appreciate the giving the firemen uh the fire companies a chance to get up there to fire uh to to uh to fight this fire Fred how long have you lived in uh the Palisades in this uh neighborhood well uh since 2004 more or less okay so you've experienced a number of fires throughout the years yeah nothing is bad as this in this neighborhood and so there pretty bad fires what is your neighbor reporting they're seeing from outside their home which is right next to yours is the fire threatening your home at the at this point it's it's not clear it depends on which way the wind is uh blowing she lives across the street uh from there and uh she says the wind keeps changing sometimes it's blowing favorably to us and sometimes it's not yeah that that makes it frustrating so at this point you're not going to attempt to go back to your home well I have a dog at my home I was trying to get to her to get her but I'm I can't get in there and here comes another [Music] engine yeah it's a tanker engine I don't know I imagine it's it's full of retardant or water um I imagine um how frustrated you are and concerned you are for your dog is there a way your neighbor can go maybe next door and get your dog for you uh I don't know um and uh PCH is closed at tcal yeah yeah they're doing check don't bother trying to get up there turning people away at that point Sunset is uh locked solid going away from the fire well certainly we hope you stay safe we live across the street from a reservoir okay excuse me no no problem thank you we appreciate you talking to us uh it's a very stressful situation obviously uh Fred wish wishing you and your family uh safety and I hope you can get some help and get your dog out of your house as well um hopefully we'll be in touch with you and our photographer can get some of your information and we'll check back in with you thank you for talking to us okay all right thank you Maria that's um that is concerning right because he's saying you know I'm getting conflicting information I also you know one minute our neighbor is telling us the wind is blowing this way the next minute the other way that makes it hard for people to know what to do well I it depends on where you are right now I mean there was that evacuation order but if you were at the top and then the road got really stuck with all those cars then they were saying shelter in place right so there were some conflicting messages that's true as far as the wind um the fire will create its own wind at some point so all of this heat the air uh mass will heat up and it rises and it just sucks in all the air from all directions but generally the winds are still coming from the Northeast so we got these very strong sanana winds we talked about it yesterday we tried to prep and warn everybody in these really vulnerable areas these are the areas actually that was under the extreme fire danger we talked about anywhere from Santa Barbara down to Ventura and in this area in Malibu Santa Monica Mountains so this is the area particularly vulnerable to these very strong wind gusts the bad news is the winds are going to get stronger as we get to theast evening hours and overnight tonight right now it's sort of um kind of in between and this is the window I think that firefighters are going to have to take advantage of getting those fixed Wings up there try to get all that water and they're flying back and forth right now from picking up and scooping the water from the ocean and dropping it but there might be a time later this evening where the winds are going to get so strong and maybe too strong for them to fly so that's what we're concerned with but the bad news is the winds are going to continue to be really uh dangerous and damaging getting some um information per the radio traffic that the Getty Villa is on the path of the fire which is um obviously unfortunate concerning that's right um it is impacting The Villa area and impacting Coastline Drive um as well it's approaching that area a long coastline drive and uh as you were mentioning Maria there's about 5 hours left of daylight when you think about it and that's the operational hours that are going to be most significant for these firefighters and you're looking at the smoke kind of going straight up which is great for right now so we're not looking at these extreme wind gusts right so this is that window yep the window of opportunity is right now and they're certainly trying to take advantage of that as you see those super scoopers making those drops right there right there hitting those Flames wow look at that it's uh dramatic um but you're right there is some change in the Wind right now in terms of the Velocity but look at that Palm FR look at how strong that wind is still blowing though and this is going to continue and even strengthen more as we get into the evening hours these wind gusts are clocking in near 60 70 M an hour there's some isolated areas up at the ridgetops that are expected to be gusting near 85 so we're talking about hurricane force wind gusts here and that can just spread the fire and of course those Embers that you see they can be spread downwind that's why there's such great concern for all of the structures and the homes and the Getty in particular The Villa downwind of this fire and we're we're getting reports of spotting on both sides of the Palisades Drive area so it is going further south toward the the shore there in the ocean so please stay alert if you're we do um we do have a Haley Winslow right now with us hey Haley um let us know where you are and who you're with and what's going on hey there Roxy yeah we just got to Will Rogers State Beach here on uh just down really from the Getty it looks very ominous the sky the traffic was insane trying to get here gridlocked and I've got a very dear friend on the line right now Eric Robertson who is trapped in the fire I've got him on my other cell phone on speaker phone so he can describe what's going on from his perspective perspective he's been sending me videos we're having a hard time getting them in Eric what's going on where you are well we're in the middle of the Palisades Highlands and we are right in between the path where the helicopters pick up the water from the reservoir and the fire itself so around us uh on one side is just billowing smoke um we were standing about 100 yards away from where the fire started right when it started we were out for a walk and the Flames were 30 50 ft tall um the helicopters dropped you know load after load of water and it still kept spreading so quickly so it's it's traveled all the way down the hill it's supposedly it's it's crossed Palisades Drive which is close to Sunset Boulevard near the PC it's our only exit and there's a car on fire down there one of our neighbors tried to drive down they returned back because the road is uh surrounded by fire so we we really have to stay put for now um the fire isn't immediately upon us but it's it's really close and it's pretty scary okay yeah they're showing your video right now Eric that we we got one of them in and yeah it's crazy I mean you definitely see the Flames the sky is just unbelievable um and here on PCH traffic finally is moving a little bit but it's been it's been gridlocked and we're hearing now that the Getty Villa is being impacted they're about to evacuate Coastline drive and people are basically having to abandon their cars um because you know they're not able to drive through um what's going on in your neighborhood like what what are people I'm sure they're not you know they're you know on edge standing by we're all at our garages outside um you know kind of waiting for the all clear everyone's got their bags packed we're kind of poised to to run away once we're able to but at the moment we just have to stay put and uh there's only there's only that one street so there's not much we can do for now so why can't you get out what what makes you trapped the road's closed right our neighborhood is is only accessible by one road that's Palisades Drive and the fire has has on has crossed that road and it's jumped onto both sides um below us so we're effectively now above and below into the middle of the fire evacuation from the city but we can't comply because um the road is uh is shut for now all right well be really careful thank you very much I'll call you back in a little bit and check on you guys but yeah thanks Eric bye that was Eric Robertson he's right there in the middle of it in the thick of it and you can hear the sirens I mean it's nonstop I mean police driving on both sides of the road um everyone's pretty much driving like a maniac when you can finally move and yeah again the sky just very ominous out here you can't even see the Santa Monica Mountains at all and I know Maria's probably kept you very well updated with the weather but the winds just in the last 40 minutes I've seen 35 mph wind gusts and it's looking like overnight tonight and tomorrow it's going to be like 65 to 70 mph wind so this is only the beginning this isn't even the peak of this monstrous Santa Ana wind event that uh we're hearing could be the strongest of the Season or roxia yeah well Maria is standing right next to and she was just mentioning how up top the winds are much even stronger so you're reporting this at the surface and you know that up at the higher elevations it's going to be gusting now closer to between 60 and 80 plus miles an hour Captain Eric Scott was saying how the conditions out there today are so bad that we have to go back to he was saying even 2011 uh was the last time that we saw the Dynamics in place the conditions the dry conditions the vegetation that that's how far back we have to go to how dangerous it is and the national WEA Service issued this PDS or potentially damaging situation and the last time we did that was early in uh December and uh that's how dangerous this situation is with these winds oh my goodness look this is what you guys were talking about people walking down to mcal and evacuated evated oh let's see if we can I wonder if we can listen in Wow Let's see our photographer is speaking to them obviously okay we don't have sound right now but hopefully we can listen and hear from their story looks like he's prepar maybe they can connect with us soon but this is just such a a hard situation for so many residents there who are under that evacuation order trying to leave perhaps can't because of the traffic but where are they going to go on foot mhm you know that's the big question right how far can they go and and who's going to help so uh you can tell that you know it's probably like the last resort okay great so I think our photographer Armando connected us with this gentleman hello sir can you hear me can you hear us if you could speak into the microphone the microphone maybe there we go there we go hold the microphone up to your mouth baby hold the microphone yeah I don't hear anybody yes we hear you do you hear us we hear him but he can't hear us looks like he's with his mom maybe give hold on hold it okay he's they're getting set up right there as we continue to look at this shot from Will Rogers this is where the command post is going to be set up and where Haley is right now um so she was speaking with a friend of hers who's in uh Palisades Highlands area right and they were saying how they were trapped and they had nowhere to go because there was only one road leading in and out palisad drive um which is really uh frustrating and really concerning Hale Lee um check back in of course throughout the throughout the day with your friend there hopefully he and his family will be okay what's your name zen zen yes I hear you guys hi do you have someone you to speak with hey hey roxia yeah this was my new friend right when we got off the air he was showing me a video he works up there in the Palisades and saw a bunch of cars on fire tell tell me what you saw oh so just cars backed up uh on the way up there's a bunch of cars that are abandoned so um let me show this you can see it come on over here abandon so he was showing us uh palm trees on fire um cars on fire yeah so I'll speed it up but um yeah so anyways I started all the way from the top and all these cars aren't going anywhere cuz some cars are abandoned and on the other side you know on the way up I saw like a palm tree on fire so I ended up like brushing it off taking it off and then on my way back down I started seeing the car on fire so here it is there it is wait can you ask so all that other side is abandoned so that's only going to get worse and then see the van you guys when you ask haly where people are abandoning their cars is it on the side of the road or just in the middle of the street it looks like it's in the middle of the street like this one van on fire I don't know if you can see it I know the glare is bad but it's it looks like they pulled over on the side of the road can you explain what I don't know which road that was but they're asking where this it's it's the main road that goes up I I don't know uh I don't know abandoning Sandra on both yeah yeah so I mean it's it's the main road and then there were parents that their kids aren't like in school and they can't even get them so they were like pretty frustrated it's it's tough for you guys to see but there's a there's basically a van that's on fire in the middle of traffic people are um abandoning it and the palm tree is on fire as well and he actually took it upon himself to put put one of the fires out but the trees just caught fire again so it's just showing the um tried to send us that video intensity of it get a better look if possible the signal is terrible but we will try to get it to you as soon as possible um but yeah it's just the magnitude of this fire and again this is only the beginning already up to 200 Acres that's another challenge that people are facing there thank you Haley the fact that the cell service is very spotty in that area to begin with on a good day now on top of that with these wind gusts and probably some power outages because these power lines are going down because of this fire and the smoke really impacting this area so imagine if you're a resident living in these communities trying to get the latest updates or trying to connect with somebody and then the service is so spotty as it is so it's really frustrating for so many people as she was mentioning people trying to get a hold of their kids who may be in school thankfully a lot of schools are closed but clearly just the situation is so stressful at this decided to have a short day and they have to go pick them up right mhm it's really tough and uh we appreciate the video that people are sending in to show us what uh they're dealing with right there but I again it is it is tough with the connectivity being as it is in Malibu and and um the PCH that area along the shore right there so it is a tough situation I wonder if we have the people from Armand's location we were watching people evacuating on foot carrying bags with them and uh it's interesting in certain uh neighborhoods that they're resorting to that let's check in with arando and his vantage point he's on the left side of the screen um looks like we didn't get a chance to speak to those people um it was hard to make that connection and they probably aren't quite in the mood to speak anyway trying to get out of uh the area not sure how far they're going to get with um having to be on foot of course we are still waiting there will Roger uh State Beach there on the right side of your screen that parking lot right there is where the command post will will be where we can get hopefully some updated information it's a little tough right now because obviously all hands on deck and they are focused on getting this fire under control before they're able to relay information out to the public but that it be the Gathering point of and it's tough for news crews to even get there we just saw one news van pull up but you can see this fire broke out at 10:30 and at this point now just crews are arriving even Haley get there and she said traffic was so backed up it's so hard to get through these locations and that's the situation not only are our news Vehicles dealing with But First Responders too trying to get through all of the people um and there is a checkpoint at this point at PCH and tascal Canyon because of the fact that so many people were trying to get to the area oh look at that beautiful Drop right there mhm and that's what we've been looking at um along this vantage point of PCH uh by Will Rogers and uh that's a good good thing that we've been looking at um these super scoopers picking up water from the ocean and then making those drops you're looking at um just a full screen right there if you can snap a picture or just uh write down the information evacuation Center at Westwood Recreation Center that's at 1350 South zulva um if you're able to get there or or pass that information along to others who may be able to use that information let's see we're looking at people in their cars trying make their way out of the area um a lot of frustrated that's LAX right there flights are um coming and going though I will tell you that I just got an update that know they they are but you know under these weather conditions They do change their flight plan so instead of coming in from the ocean they'll they'll turn and go from the inland area so there there's definitely a difference and there could be delays if you do have some plans so make sure you check with um your carrier yeah that's what Jesu was saying early on in the morning around 10:00 uh 10:30 also saying that their flight plans have changed you know when they depart and usually go out to seea right um now they're going east and and taking off that way even President Biden cancelling his planned news conference here in dedication for two new monuments in Southern California cancelled that they're going to be doing that virtually instead we had some uh some video earlier of Ontario International Airport and how windy it was there so uh really this is just a reminder for everybody if you live in the area under this Red Flag Warning which really is widespread it's pretty much all of SoCal this is a reminder for you to have your Ready set go plan in place have that bag ready red flag warnings are in effect so that means if if you live uh particularly up in some of these Canyons up in the Hollywood Hills you want to make sure you look at the parking restrictions and when you're if you're at home you want to turn your car so that it's ready to go you want to reverse in so that you are ready to go when or if that time comes for you uh especially around this area here in the Palisades Santa Monica Malibu just downwind of this fire so we have what what do like 4 hours a little bit over 4 hours of daylight right yeah sunsets are going to be about 5:00 p.m. and then after that it's going to get rapidly darker of course but that is unfortunately when we expect the winds to start to really pick up again later this evening um into the overnight hours so it's really critical that they get a handle on this fire right now the fix wi yeah the fix wi aircraft is able to go up I don't know I haven't seen any F check but it's also very difficult to see uh from this vantage point but hopefully they're doing that as well in addition to some of the water dropping you are seeing how Gusty that wind is though you know but this is as you mentioned the window of opportunity to really make some progress on this but clearly it is challenging and it's only going to get worse yeah we we heard Captain talk about how when you see a fire those first 20 minutes are so critical and if if if they can't get a handle on it then they're going to be talking hundreds right versus just a few Acres right saw thaten y we saw that in front of our eyes it started as 10 acres it blew up to more than 200 like within half an hour yeah half hour well under an hour at this point and then now who knows uh it's definitely grown yeah we're over 200 Acres yeah for sure I know that they're setting up the um Command Center and that post in Will Rogers that State Beach and so hopefully uh at some point we'll get an update an official update from them but at the moment as we take a look at this live image look at the tops of these trees and how much stronger those winds are so you can imagine where the fire is burning how much stronger even those winds are blowing and from all directions because fires create their own weather and although the prevailing winds are coming out the Northeast in around the fire it's just really very erratic and it's coming from all directions as that air rises it sucks in all the air around it and as we get closer to Nightfall the wind is really going to pick up you said yeah those wind guts are expected to be between 60 to 80 miles an hour um could even clock in between 90 and 100 that's a hurricane force winds uh in terms of those wind gusts so that can do a lot of damage not just from the wind itself but just in terms of the fire and how how much it's going to help it to spread and uh carry those Embers you know far away from the start of the fire and we've been looking at the resources that have been battling this Blaze for quite some time now especially from the air we've been seeing those super scoopers pick up that ocean water and make those dramatic drops but we do know that there more than a hundred firefighters at this point tackling this and trying to make sure that these communities are protected of course the big thing is life and then property but more than 100 firefighters tackling this as well uh I ventured to say more but with resources also from the sky you got those helicopters and those fix wi trying to make progress on this they moved quickly um and and I know that they were prepared because they even had gotten uh on loan the crws from Northern California and that's how really how prepared uh firefighters and officials were for this very severe wind event and yet this still happened I know it's um it's so frustrating for people whose whose homes are in this area who uh maybe didn't even get to go back home right to grab anything cuz they left for work early this morning and although we'd been talking about this happening it's you know still always once it happens it's right like that one resident we spoke with he knew that the threat was there he left work for work for the day got this alert from his neighbor who was home around 10:30 and then went back for his dog so I can imagine you know you may have your documents with you you may have your medication but you know you're not always going to bring your pet to work in case something like this happens and so he was just hoping to get back to his dog to to make sure his dog is safe but uh it's too dangerous to go back and and it's not wise to try to get back to your property when something like this is happening we often look at the smoke and it's an indicator of are things going well are things improving it's black it's heavy it is uh indicating that there's a lot of vegetation still lots of fuel to burn there for this fire it is um that is unfortunate um all right let's see we are coming up on 1:00 now um we've been covering this since it began if you're joining us our coverage obviously has been extended because we are watching closely the Palisades fire which has really grown since 10:30 this morning from 20 acres to 200 and plus acres uh reports of homes Burning uh ooh that's a great drop wow wow nice drop there um we're going to go to Haley actually where we are right there live shot right there at Will Roger State Beach that's where Haley Winslow is with our photographer um Haley uh fill us in yeah the good news is the we're right next to the ocean so they have all the water in the world to use to drop on this fire and unfortunately this is looking like it's going to only be the beginning all right we have zenzen back with us about 20 minutes ago he rode his electric bike up through the Palisades to check on his friends he works up there and his friends had gotten out they were fine but he saw a bunch of palm trees on fire we just uh brought you tried to bring you this video a minute ago but now we do have it for you uh there were vans on fire people just literally abandoning them in the middle of palisad drives right by Sunset and they're looking at your video right now Zen tell us what happened from your perspective so yeah so I just saw a lot of people just sitting in their car where there's a bunch of brush like uh like fires on the sides like what the heck just get out the car on the other side all the cars are abandoned on the other side people are trying to just come down it's just Cars and Cars so I was like okay they're not going anywhere but I I went all the way to the top to just check if if Buddy was okay and a there's only a certain amount of firefighters that are out there because like I said on one side to go up all the cars are abandoned so all those trucks that are coming up they can't even get up there so they're trying to clear you know the ones that are coming down so I mean it's it's there's a lot of cars but in the process yeah it was just palm trees on fire I took some out before that car CAU on fire the van and then as as on my way back down as you can tell is it caught on fire so no and you tried to put part of the fire out with the palm trees I did yeah I was I was able to next to that car but then you know it just the wind kept picking up so it just you know made the palm trees catch more on you know and just to let you guys know obviously everybody probably got that emergency alert right now but the latest evacuation warning issued from Malibu West of Los Flores Canyon Road um they just had another one um I think it was east of Los Flores Canyon Road um they're also expecting Coastline drive by the Getty Villa to be impacted next um traffic's a nightmare these alerts are non-stop the sirens are Non-Stop and um so Zen here saw the car's on fire oh watch out James um and then he tried to put the palm tree out with yeah yeah well there was parts of the palm tree that were falling down so I was just you know take taking him off the center Bush because that's where it was catching on fire so Edam going there taking it off turn it off but even then you you just see pieces of palm trees of just Fireballs just winding through and hiding cars and at one point I was like getting hit I was like okay I need to come down so yeah what's going on was there anybody in the van uh no no so on the way up it it was just left there so yeah cuz it was trying to go down but it was on the opposite side of the road okay it's gotten so close to PCH now that um even firefighters here this was the staging area for a moment but they've moved it to Gladstone so that's why everybody's kind of literally evacuated this parking lot um and just looking at the sky one more time you guys before I send it back to you it's just unbelievable and you know eerily similar to the mountain fire in cambaro where same story I heard you guys saying earlier Sandra and AR roxia just the same thing we said last time is unfortunately a lot of people had already left their homes and they were at work so you hear about the poor guy who's trying to get back home to his dog and everybody you know who's left all of their belongings and didn't even get a chance to get you know their important papers and that Ready set go bag really frustrating our hearts go out to all these people of course and and their family members and their pets and hopefully um no lives will be lost in the process um Haley thank you yeah we did see how that parking lot did pretty much empty out right and you see how fluid the situation is the fact that they've had to change their command post due to the shifting nature of this fire and how close now it's getting to Haley's location they had to move the command post down to a different area but clearly did you see and notice the difference too in her shot where she was standing it looked like daylight but if they panned over just about a 100 yards or so it look like complete Black like right here Darkness right exactly it's because the the smoke creates again its own atmosphere covering the sun right there and it can change on a dime it it just depends on the winds and how it shifts and what kind of fuel and vegetation the fire is consuming at this point so very black smoke thick Rising into the air right there uh when you look at the shot on your left creating a very different type of mood and and atmosphere for the community there at this point and then on your right hand side you're looking at more of a brown grayish smoke that thankfully doesn't look like it's gusting too much but again when you're on the scene there on the ground could be a very different situation but that's what what fire crews are dealing with you know the weather being the biggest X Factor in all this absolutely the wind is the most critical uh component when it comes to helping a fire spread and grow and also the most important component in fighting that fire I was really concerned when we saw some of that the images where the van was on fire some of the Treetops and and that could be part of the spotting when we talk about the winds and how it can carry these Embers way down from the fire where it originates so this is also a huge concern when we talk about these very strong Gusty winds they can carry an ember down a mile or two from where that fire is so that's why there's a huge concern uh well west of this fire well South and that's why that evacuation ORD is in place CU it can move in that direction very quickly as we saw how this fire just erupted and grew in just a couple minutes really and you see also uh wow thetic video taken from that Resident right there who was making his way to check on a friend in the area but oh the dramatic scene helicopters in the air taking an aerial vantage point of how far this fire has spread as you heard Captain Eric Scott saying that they deployed those aerial Crews quickly to try to assess the scene and then started attacking from the sky as soon as they could and we've been seeing all those aerial assets really working hard to try to get a handle on this but now again a live look at uh the vantage point of this fire from PCH again look at the traffic backup it's just nonstop it's getting worse at this point really not even moving but the thankfully the the cars are going in the right direction which is away from the fire so that means residents are listening and obeying the evacuation warnings and orders that are in place right now so hopefully this really saves a lot of lives and and livelihoods at this point but clearly when there's an order in place a warning in place you want to listen to officials and and not think you're the hero and ride it out in your home or even uh if you're even further away just just do it now um go the other way of course not into where this traffic is but this is what happens when you do wait a little bit too long or perhaps you're not prepared um I encourage you to be prepared now if you are not in this area the Red Flag Warning and the extreme fire danger is widespread across Southern California so this is not the only area where you should be concerned so have that ready set go fire plan in place have your bag ready make sure your cars are pointed in the right direction in your driveway and we talk about the six PS you know the people make sure your your your people your kids your family they know where to go have that plan um make sure your paperwork is in order you have copies of that your prescription medication your pets Plastics which is your cards your cash your credit cards yep so the um they are saying that they've closed the northbound lane of PCH this is near Channel Road so more closures there um and evacuation orders have been issued for the East area of Les Flores Canyon Road as well well these evacuation orders if you look on your map they have spread and uh they're just growing in size it started off as a one area of the Pacific Palisades and now um there are more communities and neighborhoods impacted by these orders so if you are getting those alerts on your phone make sure to heed the warning no matter how confused you are if you have the option between two different pieces of information go with the one that is basically telling you to get out yes exactly that is most cautionary look at that yeah and as we're looking at this live shot you're seeing those Flames really come alive right behind that home right there initially it just looked like a thick black smoke and then all of a sudden those Flames really popping up behind this properly line it's it's not what you want to see clearly it it it's you think about you know that person and the home and and uh how threatened these structures are we do know that there have been properties damaged in all of this we just don't know where and that's exactly what we're hoping to hear fire officials tell us as we wait for them to set up a command post and give us the very latest on what they know they haven't confirmed yet what property has been damaged the addresses and what we're looking at in terms of um what this fire has engulfed yet and we know that it has uh caused some damage to many structures now uh we're just waiting on some numbers there are definitely assets up in the air um I'm seeing not just helicopters but fixed wi aircraft I'm seeing at least one two three four maybe five so they have been attacking this as soon as it erupted so uh they're definitely putting a lot a lot of resources to fight this fire there are many many homes around this Canyon around this fire so there's a huge concern and this window right now that they're trying to take advantage of before the winds really pick up a little bit later is really crucial and critical so you're getting a wider shot there it gives you AIT different perspective on the left hand side that's actually a shot from LAX um there you see all of that smoke a very different image uh although you still have that blue sky and then when you look closer you can see the big change there um looks like Nightfall already right and we're a few hours away from that but very uh very different perspectives there uh reminder that there is an evacuation Center at Westwood recreation center that is 1350 C a Boulevard so if you're able to head that way if that's near you if you know people who may need that information let them know Westwood Recreation Center at 1350 South ofula Boulevard is somewhere they can go yeah I I can't remember if you can bring pets or not at Westwood um but definitely go there and find out it's a huge it's a huge facility uh so it can accommodate a lot of people a lot of cars so please take advantage they have um you know bathrooms they have showers there a there's a pool there there's um anyway they they have a lot of amenities for you if you have nowhere else to go of course and it's always a situation where when you do have to evacuate you don't ever know for how long you know and um when you'll be back or when you can what they call repopulate your neighborhood right go back to the burn area but keep in mind this is going to take some time given the magnitude of this fire how big it is how fast and quickly it's grown and we haven't seen the worst of the weather yet so brace yourself if you are leaving make sure you take enough for uh several days um and and just patience right there there are resources available for you LA County Fire uh LA City fire and um the Red Cross certainly coming into action uh whenever there's a situation like this to make sure residents who are displaced who are evacuated do get the resources they need so there will be help for you the most important thing though is to heed the warning and get out when they tell you and that is pretty much now MH you see the traffic there on pth right it's just wild that people are abandoning their cars uh if it's just impatient or nerves or uh just Panic um if you do that I guess one can hope that you pull over at least because leaving them right in the middle of the street is creating a problem for I did just see that they do accept small animals oh good at the uh Westwood um Center Recreation Center there so that's good news if you have small cats small dogs they will accept you there at Westwood and keep in mind this is grown in magnitude it's grown so large that this smoke and and flames it's really visible from all over the coastline and the surrounding area we're getting images in from the South Bay seeing all the smoke um also in La obviously and maybe you're not in and around this area but you're certainly going to feel the the air quality change depending on where you are and because of the fact that this is a severe Windstorm situation not only for this area but I'm getting notices from different athletic coaches for Youth Sports they're cancelling practices in Riverside in the inland area Inland Empire Orange County as well because this whole area is impacted by the winds actually uh a large part of SoCal is under an air quality alert not because of this fire this fire is bringing new problems of course especially if you've got any respiratory issue you want to stay indoors but the air quality alert was in place because of the blowing dust and not only that there's a mandatory uh fire wood uh burning band at the moment because that would add obviously more toxic uh particulate matter into the atmosphere so you you want to remember the air quality alert that is also in place yeah it makes sense to try to stay indoors if you can during this um I mean why why create a situation that doesn't need to to happen right well as you saw earlier we saw people actually walking around sort of the perimeter of the fire and looking and watching and that is obviously not a good idea to be doing that taking uh pictures and video which you know in the media we we want to get some of that because we want to share it with our viewers but at the same time we want you to stay safe and we want you to get out of the way out of the way of officials and firefighters trying to save uh structures here with this fire yeah don't let curiosity get the best of you if you're close to this area don't try to be a lookie L and create congestion or a problem for people who are really trying to answer the call and then if you're not in this area and you're worried about a health condition oh you're looking at some people on foot right there getting uh out of the area and look kids wearing masks because of the fact that the air quality is so bad and if you do have a a condition like asthma or respiratory issues people getting over being sick a lot of people getting sick over the holidays and still having trouble with a cough or something this is going to aggravate things even more so they're walking down I'm assuming this is tuscal I just saw on uh radio traffic here that the fire is now impacting parts of Sunset Boulevard this is near palis A's drive and that the road is impassible but we're getting word that the fire is now impacting parts of sunset near Palisades Drive and I'm assuming these people walking away from that area um which is close to this live shot I think that we're showing here right now h i wonder from our crews on the ground if they can get a sense of if any structures have been damaged or if they can see any damage from where they are um I know it's a fluid situation as you're seeing our photographer change his position right there but it's it's hard to tell at this point from our vantage point or from the pictures that we're getting in if in fact some structures have been damaged um from their we do know that there has been damage we just don't know where and we haven't physically seen it right from we haven't seen just heard reports um trying to see if there's an update regarding any evacuations um by the way the watch Duty app or if you go online just do watch Duty you can get up to the minute information regarding acreage that's burned or evacuations or just any kind of useful information there yes Maria just read you the latest update that the fire is impacted sunet Boulevard near Palisades Drive and you can't use this road at this point um so that is going to be a big problem I think we're going to see more people walking right uh just their best bet is to walk out of there if possible versus is trying to drive um PCH is moving very slowly it's like a snail's pace here but um at least we're seeing traffic slowly moving along this was Will Roger State Beach the parking lot there this is where they were going to have a command post set up but it looks like they are changing their plans that's why this parking lot is so empty at this point my gosh that Sky Maria it's just getting darker and darker yeah we had a wide shot ear C showing you the smoke from the vantage point of LAX and it was clear yes how the smoke was blowing from the Northeast towards the Southwest toward the ocean and that is a clear indication of this extreme s and a wind event that we have been talking about look at how strong the winds are here right now well Tony BTA this is the photographer uh on the ground right there giving us this shot can he hear us can he talk look at the First Responders with their masks on as well uh if he go tell us where he is and what he's experiencing I don't know that he can uh he's busy setting up this shot it just shows you uh how dramatic a fire can be and how it can impact just the atmosphere in terms of how dark it is it looks like nighttime there this is at Gladstones where they're setting up their emergency command center and First Responders will be giving us an update there but PCH and sunset is what you're looking at and the traffic just getting out of that area and look how populated it is uh to to feel the effects of this fire at this point is is really quite concerning for all of those people living in those multi-unit Homes apartments condos they're trying to get out wow well you saw the masks but also you saw the goggles because you can imagine how the smoke and the debris is just irritating all of your senses including your eyes and your nose and this is the stuff that you can see what about the stuff that you can't see you know that that's there that's very toxic for our lungs and so that's why we encourage you to wear a mask and if you're not in evacuation Zone uh stay indoors and shelter in place if that's a luxury at this point right right right you know the um in the village in the Pacific Palisades just sort of east of where that fire is it is closed on Sunset so if you're trying to get out maybe that way um it's going to be kind of tough as those roads are also I'm imagine packed but it is closed if you're trying to get in maybe you have a dog we heard from uh a gentleman in a family earlier how uh he left and he left his dog at home um we do not encourage you to go back and try to to get your animals but um I know it's they're like a family member right so it's tough it's tough yeah yeah we were just um getting some information from our director that we have a image of a home on fire sadly um if we can get that image and show oh okay a live look we've been talking about that there were reports of homes on fire and we hadn't yet seen it and unfortunately there it is do we have a loc locator here do we know where can you hear me right now oh Matthew seedorf is here on all right yes yes we can so we're off of Shadow Mountain Drive we've been watching the flame should quickly take over home and the winds are blowing to our right right now about about 15 miles an hour is what I've been measuring but it's really sad to see we've been hearing these pop and more structures down the hill go up in Planes very quickly as it spreads a lot of residents out here have been asking us pulling over as they evacuate wondering where are the firefighters well we don't see any firefighters where we are we understand that traffic in the area is a mess but it's super tragic to see a home like this get engulfed in these ples so there so there are no firefighters where you are are you seeing any of the super scoopers or water dropping helic Ops up above what are you what are you seeing exactly we're not we're not seeing any firefighters or or any drops from the sky but if you look up here there's another looks like another home in Flames behind this gate um just a lot of people looks like evacuated very quickly it's dead up here but again no firefighters that we've been able to see and the people that we have talked to are wondering where they are as we continue to see the Flames push further and further down this hill how how hard was it for you to come up to this neighborhood the traffic in area is really bad so uh we had to do some maneuvering even the cell reception right now is not great that's why we're actually using Wi-Fi to do this live shot for you but U it's just it's a mive areally to get out here and you can see hey Matt what's that main road that you're standing at right there um is that saddle saddle Mountain Drive Saddle Mountain Drive okay Shadow thank you Shadow M yeah well it's difficult it's I know it's heartbreaking for residents who say where are all the firefighters you know why aren't there any Personnel here it's just so expansive at this point and it quickly spread and then the fact that they're dealing with all of these people trying to get out of the area or get into the area the traffic as you even reported Matthew and showed us it's just a nightmare to try to get in and out of uh that area and that region and then trying to you know allocate the resources accordingly obviously the first priority for First Responders is to protect life and property and it it is it is heartbreaking to see people's livelihoods their homes go up in Flames but but we are seeing firsthand how these first respond ERS are working so hard to try to put this out and clearly it's just the combination of the the terrain plus the winds as you're seeing right there and you're feeling it Matthew right the the winds really whipping around yeah you can feel the wind in the extreme heat coming off the fire it looks like they have some sort of sprinkler system set up in the lawn here uh but it doesn't appear to be working as this F keep pushing further and further down the hill right now towards sow Mountain drive so Shadow Mountain and what's the nearest cross street we have Shadow Mountain B okay so you're up at the The Ridge View Country Estates you're kind of like in between the village and the Palisades and the summit that's way way way at the top there but uh you're really close to the Canyons but there's a lot of homes up there Matt and and uh it's just so devastating to see this one in particular this structure and this fire um are you seeing any other people at all up there on your way up or do you think that a lot of them were able to get out when we got to the main road off of BM Bonita it got noticeably quiet as we got closer to the fire lot of the residents had pushed out um but again it seems like the firefighters might be having a tough time getting out here we know that the fires expanding very quickly uh but the one the couple residents that we have seen up on this three particular Shadow Mountain drive we the ones that are kind of wondering what's going on where's the help um but it does feel like that a lot of people in this area left very quickly and as you mentioned it is a a very residential area there's a lot of homes burning right now such a Eerie I I feel as though not I'm not there but watching you such an eerie kind of feeling where you are yeah definitely a very eerie feeling uh you can feel the ass getting pushed out by the fire and the heat that we're kind of backing up a little bit um but really yeah we're the only ones up here and we actually tried calling the fire department ourselves tried calling I but the cell so bad the only way that we have to talk to you right now is through Wi-Fi oh that explains that's another challenge we've been talking about yeah the connectivity in that area just even without a fire and the wind it's so spotty depending on where you are and you can imagine for the residents they looking to get information get information yeah contact loved ones figure out what to do call for emergency help it's it's so tough they can't get out they can't get the the service that they need yeah it's a it's a tough situation and the people that we've been able to talk to very briefly you can tell that they're in shock uh they're going through all the emotions right now is their their neighborhoods uh you know being impacted by this fire particular and yeah this direction again we've been talking about these we've been talking about winds and we might need to SC closer to the the Wi-Fi here but uh I've been measuring the winds with our anomer it's about 15 mil hour pretty consistently but we've seen dust over 20 miles hour uh also obviously pushing this fire making it grow even more there's there's a school nearby I'm assuming that they evacuated St Matthews it's a it's a known school there up in the Palisades and the parish I'm not sure if you drove past it on your way up there Matthew but um I just in case if you saw any kids or any people at all down there yeah it looks like they were being evacuated we did we did Drive pass all the way over we just the traffic in that area been so bad we saw parents walk to the kids we saw school buses it appeared like everything was happening very quickly obviously no one had any sort of warning that this fire was going to start today they were all going about their day and then it was quickly everything you can get your kids and get out I just feel for those families and those parents and hopefully yeah they all got out yeah we're seeing a lot of residents on foot Matthew even uh getting away from that area and even First Responders with their goggles and their face masks uh really trying to protect themselves from the conditions up there it looks terrible uh in terms of the pollut in the air and just the air quality you must be dealing with Matt yeah the air quality is not good um as you can see we're wearing our our mask right now and just the the wind the smoke the fire you can feel the heat if you're really close and I mean you can tell we've been walking in the street for the last 10 minutes or so and there's no one here there's no firefighters um and again we tried calling but so far time got a response is cell reception so poor we're gonna actually change locations right now see if we can okay we'll let you get back to it Matt and Matthew as we um wait for him to change locations let's take a look at the map and uh the areas he's talking about because we are looking at the red right there that's the evacuation orders that are in in effect right now so if it's red means you leave now so anyone living in those red areas leave now if you haven't left already the yellow areas that's where an evacuation warning is in effect it's in place right now that means be ready to leave right have your foot out the door leave leave if you want leave if you can uh do the right thing get out early the problem is where are they going to go so PCH is pretty much gridlocked at the moment but it is away from the fire so that's a good thing so I guess they could go north north yeah they could go north up and around um you know get into the valley maybe go to oxer area uh it is a tough situation but you got to think on your feet and then be ready to go and and do what's best for for you and your family and for the surrounding Community just so you're not a problem cuz you don't want to add to being the problem here cuz it's it's tough as it is for people who are watching this and and realizing that these Flames are impacting so many people's homes and livelihoods look at how close to the property line yeah we were just um close we just switched cameras there but that was Matthew and he was telling us how they have no cell service so they were using um Wi-Fi right um Matthew and our photographer Armando arm oh this is Armando okay this is Armando's camera okay um so there we have yes the Flames so close to that home right there um man it's tough to watch this right it is he was up there at Shadow Mountain Drive and he was Vita B Vita he was saying how it was pretty much um empty of people however there were no firefighters and and and the fire was getting really close to where he was but as you said Sandra they're getting called to where the danger is at its highest at the moment um and so you can't expect them to be there but I'm I'm glad they evacuated that's exactly the right thing to do so that firefighters can go to where they're most needed at the moment where that fire is uh really critical to life first and then property and it looked like that homeowner did take all the precautions they had the fire clearance with a lot of people living in that area they're known to have uh fire threats and and prone to These Warnings over the years and they've done their best they've listened to fire officials if you live in an area where you are in those fir prone areas that you must have the clearance right around the home the mountains and that house even Matthew was mentioning had like a water sprinkling system in place on the ground it wasn't working which is U the other thing but to take precautions like that especially if you live in an area where you know it might be a situation like this and then um to watch that happen to your home is really heartbreaking I mean there's only so much you can do right with Mother Nature yeah um well look at the how the the pictures are changing as we speak you know and it's going to be night soon and it's going to make everything much more difficult um as the winds are going to pick up that's the biggest issue we've got red flag warnings that are in effect through tomorrow evening um extreme fire danger will continue through at least tomorrow and as I look at some of our computer models the winds right now are actually probably at their weakest and they're only going to get stronger according to the models as we get into the evening and overnight hours so this is really that critical window that firefighters have and able to uh fly the fixed Wing aircraft fly some of the helicopters to try to attack this fire from the air when is is it expected to improve at some point that's a really good question in terms of the really strong strong winds it will not be until after late tomorrow oh Thursday will really be the day when we see a noticeable change and how these winds relax the irony of the forecast I think is this morning we were talking about rain and snow yes and and how it was impacting parts of the Inland Empire as the storm system was just too far from this area to really impact us with much needed precipitation but all of that rain and snow fell over the San berino mountains parts of the uh L uh Los Angeles National Forest but it has now since dissipated has moved East so it we're dry everywhere at this point so don't let your guard down if you are down in the Inland Empire um you know parts of the San Ana mountains Down Below in the foothill communities the winds are strong there and the fire danger is High pretty much everywhere so please be prepared use this moment now to get prepared if you aren't already you know one thing that's good is that the super scoopers are still around because I believe their contract was supposed to expire in December and they kept them around which is um awfully helpful obviously the conditions have been just terrible so they were anticipating this we were anticipating that this was going to happen and the national wealth Service issued a PDS Red Flag Warning that means a potentially dangerous situation and on the scale of high to extreme we are at the extreme level right now so this is uh something that doesn't happen very often and I think it was Captain Eric Scott that told us that it was 2011 was the last time that he saw conditions like this develop so quickly um in terms of the danger we do have Haley Winslow on the scene out there talking to Residents and uh getting new video as to what's happening let's go back to her and what the situations like out there Haley it's crazy it's very crazy to say the least um and we're actually trying to figure out where the command post is it keeps changing so we can get you the latest information there were about 5 fire trucks that just flew out of here um being deployed so this is I guess kind of a makeshift staging area I did just get the latest 911 call talking about the homes on Shadow Mountain Drive where Matthew seedorf is um that are threatened about a dozen I'm just going to play it for you real quick I was just trying to do that real quick while you uh came to [Music] [Applause] me getting dozens of calls from Shadow Mountain drive across via crest for home so I we have about a dozen calls coming from Shadow so basically they I'm just playing it for you live I'm hearing it as well for the first time but that just came in and it's basically saying a dozen homes threatened on Shadow Mountain Drive uh where Matthew seedorf was just a minute ago but it dozen homes they said they don't have anyone there and they're trying to deploy some firefighters that's probably where these guys in the parking lot were going um because they were saying on that radio call that they had no firefighters nearby um now I do have a friend I just got off the phone with him the one we introduced you to earlier today Eric Robertson he and his wife Trisha are trying to evacuate right now um they've been trapped for the last few hours uh they understand that the um the road they thought the road was open so they've got their Ready set go bag ready to go only to find out that it's closed so um it's definitely nerve-wracking I would say everyone around here is is on edge um I also just got an alert that a whole bunch of cars um are on fire a lot more than the one we showed you earlier and people are literally just ditching their cars like just leaving them in the middle of the road and firefighters are going into the burning cars trying to pull people out I'm not sure exactly which road that is on the one we showed you earlier when we we introduced you to the guy on the electric bike Zen that was on uh palisad drive right off of sunset um just right if you know the area right past the Starbucks he said he that's where the palm trees were on fire as well I'm not sure if that's where these other cars were but the alert said that there were about a dozen cars on fire and firefighters pulling people out um that's the latest here we're going to try to find the command post so that we can bring you the most official information but just another live look at the sky um and obviously the winds right before you guys came to me nearly knocked me off my feet um easily 35 mile per hour gusts here in the last hour or so and as Maria's been saying it's far from the worst of it um here just in the Palisades I saw 70 m per hour gusts are expected overnight tonight and tomorrow um and then of course like in the mountains 80 to 100 m per hour gusts so um this is definitely no joke and uh Maria would know more but it looks like from the last I saw looks like it was on par to be the worst Santa anas of the season I can see a chaotic scene we're looking at uh video Haley thank you of some residents on foot and the dramatic change in the sky also just debris flying you know maybe a plastic bag in the air but it just shows you how those wind gusts can really pick up debris and and trash and litter and and Embers Embers that's why those cars are on cars on fire mhm cars trying to make their way out the Palm frons we were getting reports of some of the Treetops are on fire and it just speaks to how strong these winds are and the Damage it can do and how erratic it can be and how prepared we need to be I guess as as much as we can it's always a good sign when you see some white smoke let me tell you right a it's a bit of a relief in in for the moment before for the moment we are seeing a little bit of that so that's that's encouraging um but you know one of the residents we were speaking with was saying how it's confusing and there's conflicting information and you know one minute the wind blows this way the next minute blows the other way so they don't quite know yeah but that that speaks to the nature of a fire there is no uh we can't control the fire necessarily in terms of what it does we can only tell you in forecast what the prevailing winds will be and the winds are generally because of the weather dynamics that are in place are coming from that northeasterly direction and the Dynamics uh we're talking about upper air support I don't I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty of what's going on but basically we have a very strong and severe San wind event H with these wind gusts that are potentially nearing 60 to 80 plus miles per hour some areas could get Winds near 90 to 100 miles an hour and that can do a lot of damage you know what I'm noticing on the right hand side uh I don't see any more cars making their way down and turning yeah they may have L CL Clos off the road at some point mhm um upset Sunset I think we're looking at um Sunset very few yeah well let's listen to one person who had to evacuate we we were quickly able to talk to this woman right here I couldn't see flames it's just you're in a golf of smoke like I mean it is black down there oh my God the minute I saw people look at us and say you have kids get out of your car and walk I just got out of the car we just walked oh my gosh so scary for families there and children you know getting out of school or maybe missing school and uh knowing that there's this warning in place those children with masks on trying to leave the area oh gosh yeah here we go we're we're looking at that multi complex or multi-unit complex it's a fire station this is just off PCH yeah sunset uh this is a fire station it looks like looks like a residential no this is a residential area on the right hand side on the right hand yeah no that's yeah residential but yeah from our vantage point it's on fire right or is it behind I can't tell if it's the roof or if it's but there's there's definitely structures between what that what we're seeing in front and what we're seeing in the back that is okay so we're getting word that this apartment complex is on fire you seen the roof there as well as a nearby fire station also on fire so that is what we're hearing right now and you're looking at it and and Maria you've been talking about these flying Embers you never know where they're going to land what they're going to set off and this is a perfect example of that because you're seeing just the flames right here where the other flames right right so far so far away must just been blown from where the fire originated so this is all part of spotting and how the fires and these Embers can get carried with wind and it can move one two miles down wind so this is a clear example of that and how the fire can impact you so far away from where it originates wow look at how quickly uh a property can go up in Flames like that and a lot of times those Embers just fly onto the roof or into those Eaves attic trapped in there Y and then explodes um where Matthew was earlier in the neighborhood where he was saying people were saying where the firefighters where the super scoopers there's nothing happening it's because they're struggling to resources are obviously limited and so they were trying to make their way to the these areas but of course uh it comes to saving people's lives first and then protection of property is secondary and Haley did uh play that 9911 call and it happened to be that very specific area where Shadow M Shadow M where Matthew cedr was and they were saying they were trying to get resources out there but you know time is of the essence and um right there were no rigs nearby there's no personel it's hard to get to the area so oh look it looks like oh I can't tell for a moment it looks encouraging and then well it does look like so it kind of it looks somewhat uh extinguished a little bit but how uh but it's definitely still burning huh oh no we definitely see Flames here I mean this is Broad but the latest alert from LA City Fire are saying evacuate now from the area of Pacific Palisades and those not in the evacuation order should shelter in place so again a broad statement but clearly they're trying to cover the most ground that they can in terms of protecting residents and you never know where the Embers are going to fly which direction and that's why it's really hard to to say what the next evacuation area is going to be or or how dire the situation is going to be for where you are but right now it says um I believe a twostory duplex um just trying to get the the latest on these structure flyers and and the brush fires that are taking place right now all over Southern California but this one of the most dramatic Pacific Palisades the Palisades fire right here this is I believe Sunset and PCH right it's getting into a real populated area though I'm surprised at how quickly it spread and then really impacting this area where there's so many residents and homes and buil and uh businesses so many to get into that area yeah this fire was sort of um originated in this Canyon between the Pacific Palisades Village area and some of those homes that wind up higher up on the Ridge and so it was it was really close too close to these homes and we're already hearing how it has a affected structures off of Palisades Drive off of Lackland Lane if you're familiar with the Pacific Palisades area it's heavily populated this is a very desirable area to live in a lot of homes here big homes small homes and uh the wind has been consistently strong since we got on the air this morning and we're talking about winds sustained near 40 50 mph and then those wind gusts the higher you go naturally it's going to be a lot stronger and even where Matt seedorf was at wasn't too high up maybe a th elevation um it was gusting near 50 60 miles an hour as he was reporting to us so these winds are going to continue and they're going to get stronger According to some of the computer models we're watching it's going to get up to 60 plus miles an hour in terms of sustained winds later this evening with those wind guts much stronger than that nearing hurricane force wind gust to 80 plus miles an hour M definitely over 200 Acres have burned you know we haven't gotten an update recently from a Fire official but at last check that was the case and that's been over an hour so yeah and more than 100 firefighters deployed um fing this Blaze with aerial assets as well I suspect that number will be much higher to given the fact that we added more resources from Northern California and other areas in anticipation for this big wind event but clearly this is what we were hoping not to see today uh but maybe perhaps inevitable given the terrain and the and the wind situation and and this is the area that's trying to recover from the Franklin fire where 4,000 Acres had been scorched and I believe 48 homes or structures had been damaged so this is getting hit hard right it's really sad to see obviously uh when when you see a populated area like this and and livelihoods um being threatened and damaged and then people fleeing like that one woman we saw with children yeah uh not knowing where to go now this map that you're seeing on the right hand side of your screen here these are uh basically wind reports current wind reports and they're strong uh in from Ventura to the Malibu area to where those fires are right now it's these are sustained winds nearing 20 30 miles an hour so you know that the wind gusts are much stronger and these winds are only Fanning these Flames spreading this fire even further and we're seeing the results of those spotting the spotfires as these numbers are getting carried down wind um these winds are going to continue unfortunately and I really can't emphasize enough how you need to be prepared even if you're not in especially if you're not in this area yeah because the fire danger and the extreme weather conditions are going to be with us through tonight and through tomorrow trying to hear what they're saying it it can be a chaotic situation yeah we're we're kind of listening to our crews on the ground right there providing this ground shot of First Responders quickly going to a situation that needs help and um wow this was an area an intersection that was backed up with traffic and now it's kind of deserted yeah you know I'm not sure if that's toena um if if the photographer could let us know exactly this intersection is it I think that's Sunset is it sunset okay Sunset and PCH um sunset's going to be closed so I know people are going to try to get in or outed y right Sunset is closed all the way up as you get um to the village and oh that part is out it looks like right well we're seeing the white smoke we're not seeing the Flames like we were earlier I do see some Flames though at the very tip top there and at the bottom so it no it's still definitely um it's going there's fire yeah it's hidden um major utilities by the way South uh Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric uh could be cutting off power to nearly half a million customers because of this fire that's happening now now and the fire threat that is looming as a result of the santanaa wind so just be aware that is uh a possibility let let's go to uh our crws on the ground we do have Crews on the ground the situation is that it's very hard to get a signal out from this area because of the fact that this area and residential community in general is difficult to get a signal out of but then on top of that with the high winds and all of the cell traffic from First Responders Communications and also this fire is proving to be very difficult but we do have video from Matthew seedorf who spring into action on his own take a look at this so we have Matthew right there on the scene there I don't know what intersection this is but he Shadow Mountain Drive he grabbed a garden hose he saw and then was putting out these Flames but he was mentioning how there's and and Haley too how a lot of cars were catching on fire because I could imagine from their description they were saying these Palm FR and Embers were coming down from the sky kind of like fireballs and then attacking these cars and like you saw right there some trash cans going on fire because of these Embers just flying around and then debris catching on fire so it looks like that that's was the situation and Matthew just grabbed a garden hose to put those out but the car fires are another example of how dangerous these flying Embers can be or or a situation where a palm FR becomes that kind of Fireball that's hitting your car and then and then it catches a flame I can imagine uh some of the home homeowners residents that are watching us right now they're they're seeing their homes here off Shadow Mountain off PCH off Sunset and just the kind of stress and anxiety and fear yeah um that must be going through here's more video it looks like um is this of Matt oh my gosh mat again stay safe putting out more fires trying to protect these homes this is sad a Shadow Mountain Drive Drive and this was an area where he was reporting he said signals very bad to try to uh get communication let's listen I don't know if there's sound on this let's [Music] hear so it looks like that he took matters in his own hands he was saying that residents who were fleeing and him from his perspective there were no fire crews around so uh I think you heard the 911 call from Haley Winslow indicating that they need help in that area and there were no crews around so again Matthew and his crew springing into action um with that garden hose but it's exactly what fire Crews don't want you to do do not stay in your home when there is an evacuation order a garden hose is not going to protect you your life or your property neither will your swimming pool so don't unless unless you have to take refuge in your swimming pool unless it's a dire situation where there's a flame right up on you but do not just hunker down in your swimming pool to try to ride this out don't try to ride this out with your garden hose this is exactly what fire Crews say please do not do this was just Matthew being a super reporter and uh taking matters into his own hands while he was reporting there on the scene but again if you're do not try this at home um by the way the super scoopers had to take a break because they had to go fuel up so that's also why we're not seeing them right now um they are you know resources getting ready to come back and uh fight this fire so we're we're approaching 2:00 here and we have what like 3 hours left of daylight which um is concerning and uh soon as it's nightfall those winds are expected as Maria's been saying to pick up you know what's interesting with this image uh thankfully mhm these Flames some oh are just almost like they're haven't moved they're in this one specific area and they're not and again this speaks to the wind right it's because of the wind that they haven't gone down towards that home um thankfully I don't know how long they'll it'll stay this way but the winds are going the other direction right and that tells you the the winds tell the story of how this fire is going to go right and there's a random quality about fires or any natural disaster given the fact that it's so Random you never know what's going to be impacted what can be in the line of fire in terms of uh an ember flying or what is saved and it really depends on the nature of the weather system that the fire creates on its own which way the wind is blowing as axio was mentioning and uh what kind of terrain is being burned right now are there going to be flying em uh around this situation thankfully the property we're looking at hasn't hasn't been affected by that close Burning Flame right there which looks like it's uh going up on that Hillside which is usually the the way fires work they go up quickly along a hillside instead of rather going down just depending but uh in this situation it it is a very close situation but it looks like it's a good one at least for that prop all right we lost the shot there uh I'm getting word that fire station 23 to Leona and sunset is on fire what do you mean okay all right we're going to take a quick break we'll be right back with our continuing coverage of this breaking news Palisades fire burning more than 200 Acres [Music] [Music] C [Music] [Music] I was heading home up above our station e dealing with the poor air quality and the situation with residents trying to evacuate and come back into the neighborhood as well but we have reporters on the ground all throughout the area trying to give us their live reports in a in a difficult situation where connectivity is an issue as well as the current conditions surrounding the fire we're seeing cars now come down sunset for a while there we didn't see much right the road is closed though that being said so we don't know um I wasn't sure if those were First Responders or contractors or civilian vehic utility yeah you never know it's it's kind of a mix uh of who they let through some of these road closures and at what point they they turn people away but clearly they want to keep those paths open for First Responders medical emergencies and people who need to get to the area in order to tackle this Blaze but we've been watching this one property right here with the Flames burning bright and big right behind this property and thankfully it's not a BL tackle this Blaze but we've been watching this one property right here with the Flames burning bright and big right behind this property and thankfully it's not a blaze yet but people are not in there obviously they're out of that hole looks really close I don't think so uncomfortably close I I don't know if um you heard me but I was mentioning in a turn of events here uh fire station 23 on Los Leones and sunset his on fire which is um ironic to say the least unfortunate and hopefully they have the resources there to make sure that everything is protected and they can get that out quickly but uh we are standing by we're going to the command post where fire officials are set to give us the latest update we have no word yet on what time that'll be but we know they are trying to situate resources there and get fire officials there to tell us what exactly is happening but you're looking at a live picture of people evacuating on foot with their belongings and fire Personnel aiding uh local residents to where they need to go and try to get out of Harm's Way and into uh a safer location we do know that there is an evacuation Center set up at Westwood recreation park and that is where residents are urged to go and you can get the resources you need if you do need to find shelter or other evacuation um Necessities right here is the evacuation Center there it is on your screen this is the address 1350 South seula Boulevard this is the Westwood Recreation Center so all evacuees displaced residents you can go there small pets are allowed as well and uh hopefully they'll be some Personnel to help you with the resources you need we know Red Cross usually comes out to help facilitate facilitate those who need some help this image is just really fascinating right to see now it now you see some sun and some blue skies it's changing constantly with this one home that we keep watching so many close calls with this one home with those Flames burning right behind it and somehow thank God right it's been spared so far um the wind's going up that hill up into the side Wonder on the back side if there's like a big fire clearance that we don't know about that's really protecting this property or not but oh what a what nve wrecking if you're watching this and it's your home where you know someone who lives here and what a difference when you see the charred background of the the trees that have no leaves or foliage and then you see the foreground where you see all that Lush vegetation but uh wow as we widen out you can see the damage those Flames have caused all along the mountain side right there and still a lot of hot spots to contend with but earlier we saw the heroic work of all those super scoopers making drop after drop just filling up along the ocean and then flying over PCH to make those drops along the flame line but right now as you mentioned Roxy fueling right a break to refuel and um the proximity of um you know having the ocean right there certainly is helping the situation where they're able to quickly move in scoop the water they need and um do the work they need to do we're back at this uh this is another image we've been watching for a while now this is a uh residential building right there and um for a while now we've been watching the Flames here there was a moment where we thought oh it looks like it's out but no it's not we're back to where we were about half hour ago when we started watching this building yeah this is a long Sunset I believe in PCH there's a really populated area right there where there's uh different apartment buildings condos there's a gas station on the corner cor a lot of delies and restaurants as we widen out you can see the shot right there the fact that the Flames are right along that populated area we do have Crews along the scene right there let's go to Christy Fardo and Christy if you could hear us tell us where you are and what you're seeing we're actually on Sunset near tascal and you were talking about how nerve-wracking it is to watch these images but imagine being in it and we just talked to a very frantic mother who was running with with her three children and she told us she had come from bienen Venita which is out that way closer to the flames and she was trying to get home because she said she had a baby at home and she didn't want to try to drive because of what you're seeing here take a look it is bumper to bumper and very slow going again this is Sunset and we are near near to Mescal Canyon and I actually drove in from West LA and I can tell you this traffic is backed up here all the way into Santa Monica chiaka is backed up so is Channel Road people just trying to leave and firefighters say that 30,000 people are under a mandatory evacuation order and unfortunately in these Canyons there are not a lot of options on how to get out so people have to use the same roads and this is what you get fortunately though as I was driving in only in the distance there did I see any Flames so there isn't any fire burning in this direction towards Santa Monica that Monica at least that I could see so even though it is slow goinging and it is bumper to bumper hopefully everyone will get out safely they just need to be patient and I did talk to one person earlier who told me that he had tried to leave starting at 11:00 a.m. and it took him 2 and 1/2 hours to reach Santa Monica so again you're going to need to be patient but uh you should be able to get out wow that that is to that is wild the story you told about that mother my goodness your heart just goes out to her hopefully uh she and her children will be safe and protected you know we were talking earlier at least uh in a different part of town people were abandoning their cars in the middle of the road and taking off um that was really causing a problem for vehicles trying to make their way in as far as fire trucks are concerned and other rescue operation Crews to help the situation out so you're not seeing any of that obviously you're just seeing bad traffic bumper to- bumper traffic there I think we lost Christy there okay well the good thing is I I believe where chrisy was that everyone's going in the right direction which is away from the area we don't want to see Cars trying to get into the area to congest things even further for first responders who are trying to go in and really tackle this because as you can see right there this is property damage that we're seeing uh one of the first images of a structure on fire and when you think about this this is Sunset and PCH a very populated area we're talking about a multi-unit apartment complex right here this is bordering an area where there's a lot of businesses and a gas station we're not talking about just a Canyon Road M that's not very populated with you know just several homes and that's it we're talking about an area where it's very dense in population and so my heart goes out to all of those other areas that we haven't seen yet on camera that could be impacted by this because we do know there are confirmed reports of structures damaged we just don't know how many or where they're located but we're getting a firsthand look at at how devastating this fire is already and the livelihoods and people's homes uh Up in Flames it's hard to watch and as we saw Matthew seedorf on Shadow Ridge Road and Ben Venita Avenue that area too he saw structure damage as well and he said there were no fire Crews inside obviously resources are spread out Fanning the area and it is very difficult to get to every hot spot let's take a look at new video we have coming into our Newsroom right here waa look at the palm tree right you saw how it was tilted how loud that sound is just um imagine being in that area right yeah it just goes to show how destructive a fire can be and the smoke uh coupled with the wind which is really driving this uh devastation and the noise it can make all of that vegetation going up in flames and Maria's been talking about we talk about this all the time how the fire creates its own atmosphere its own weather system and you're seeing it right there sometimes circulating you don't know which way the winds are going to blow at times and things shift on at a second's notice so uh you never know which way the Embers are going to fly which way smoke is going to go and there you see people people evacuating forced to leave their homes taking off walking at this point right you don't know if there oh the vehicles on fire that was something we were showing earlier and talking about um you're thinking how did that happen because of those Embers that fly and just like that they get caught somewhere and that's the result of it and um the person who was in that vehicle got out okay right and you're looking at all these abandoned vehicles cuz people just left their cars right there because of that situation where palm frons or Embers became these Fireballs coming down onto their cars they left their cars there and went by foot and you see people evacuating with their belongings you you got to think about how dire the situation is if you're going on foot in a town where no one walks right La nobody's walking there's no public transportation to really help these people along but to think about their only only choice they think is to leave by foot and that just shows you how dire the situation is and how desperate it must have been to to think that's the best solution oh my gosh look at this gentleman you wonder what the story is here where he has nothing with him he's just walking hopefully he's okay H just trying to get out and get to safety and and you know looking behind you and wondering if your house or your home or or everything you have is okay we're back live the same image we've shown you for a long time now and look at how difficult it is to even see what's going on out there how poor the air quality became it was bad enough as it was and now it's becoming even worse um do you see that and that's why you see so many of the First Responders who are actually right stationed in this area they had goggles on this is for that very reason how irritating this is is for their eyes uh their their noses um The Masks of course is a [Music] must wow it just goes to show how everything can change in a minute as I was mentioning when it comes to fires like this and and the precautions and the protection you need to have to really uh be in area like this and that's why they say evacuate and when those evacuation orders went into effect which was about two two and a half hours ago at this point so I'm hoping everyone left but as you heard Christy Fardo say that one man who left at 11 it took him 2 hours to get from the Palisades to Santa Monica we're seeing many of these fire trucks and police vehicles making their way down um from Sunset and they're turning there onto PCH it looks like um that's interesting right not just one or two several making their way down onto PCA right now let's see uh closures in place here southbound PCH at Los Flores Canyon Road Southbound PCH at toena Canyon Boulevard Coastline drive and southbound PCH those are the closures you need to know about according to CHP traffic in these areas are going to be diverted to the north bound on PCH um also uh radio traffic is indicating that Sunset Boulevard completely closed due to uh due to more than 100 abandoned vehicles wow so that's why we're seeing so many people walking on foot 100 abandoned vehicles but again you you think about what it would take for you to mentally make that decision that being on foot and walk somewhere is safer than being in your car so you just think about the frustration people must have felt and and the the fact that they they felt that it was that big of an emergency what they were facing the threat that they took off on foot with a lot of suit cases and some cases some with children young children in right and looking back and wondering what's going to be left behind wow it's really heartbreaking and and hard to watch but uh clearly this is going to go on for some time because this is not even the peak of the Winds as we're watching those those palm trees right there really swaying the winds are picking up and keep in mind Sunset is in about 3 hours it's going to be even harder for First Responders to really get a handle on this with the winds picking up and then come nighttime visibility is poor I it's a tough fight ahead and so they had a window of opportunity to really make progress on this fire which they did thankfully scooping up a lot of water from the ocean and making a lot of those water drops but right now you could see a very very different turn of events they have about three hours to do what they can really Maria mentioned that the winds are going to back down and things will improve um Thursday morning if that right so we still have a ways to go getting an acreage update now wow so we went from 200 acres to 7 00 700 Acres charred so that was in about 2 hours of course the acreage is always a lagging indicator it's the last thing that they kind of assess because they're in the middle of really fighting this fire the last thing they're doing is really surveying uh all these statistics at that point so that's the last thing they tell us but given the fact that it has what tripled now from 200 to 700 in the last hours right you know 10 even uh a small vegetation fire came across us at 10:30 in the morning and now exploded 700 Acres burned and counting but clearly this is really tough to watch and we're still waiting for an official update from the command post which is being set up and again a fluid situation there with them changing locations given the fact that this fire is ever changing and widespread they've had to move that location for fire Crews and news crews before they can give us an official update on camera so we are waiting for that we do know that that's going to happen we have several reporters all throughout the scene there uh it is very difficult though to get connectivity and to get them to the locations because there's so much traffic all these roads backed up with evacuees trying to get out of the area you know I was surprised to read about the 100 cars abandoned because when we were talking about people abandoning their cars I didn't think it was that many um I thought it was a handful here in there but um 100 Vehicles abandoned in the middle of the road really tells you how serious the situation is so uh one more time let's go over these road closures uh according to PCH here you've got southbound PCH at Los Flores Canyon Road you have southbound PCH at toena Canyon Boulevard you've got the coastline drive and southbound PCH um these are areas obviously you don't have much option at all uh everything being diverted to the Northbound PCH right now so um those who've been able to get out and have been fortunate enough to get out uh of Harm's Way uh and those who don't have much of an option at this point um you know do not attempt anything extra heroic here uh want to remind you that there's very little your garden hose is going to do don't put yourself in a dangerous situation we did speak to a fire captain who said there were reports that people were you know getting into their pools if they had one to avoid um harm and injury and that is obviously a last resort option if that is your option and you're surrounded by Flames but if you're able to get out safely if you were able to get out safely consider yourself lucky I know a lot of people had left for the day they were at work this happened around 10:30 in the morning so uh they were unable to go back to their homes and they had no choice but to basically not make it back and um that's extremely frustrating but um your life is not replaceable your property is as hard as it is to um face that right um it's tough but um let's see we on PCH and sunset there and I thought this is where they were going to set up the command post but we haven't gotten an update I think it has changed a couple of times and as we a wait for officials to give us the official uh update on camera we do want to give you the total information that we have now in terms of acreages burned Acres burned I should say 700 Acres burned so far 0% containment there are mandatory evacuation orders in place at this point there are evacuation ation warnings as well in and around the area if there is an evacuation order please get out there are several road closures to contend with as well and uh we know that Sunset and areas of PCH are closed as well as uh TOA Canyon uh Boulevard so please please please heed the warnings and stay safe and out of Harm's Way okay so uh it looks like that command post uh we have an image here they're getting ready for for um a briefing right so we we were looking forward to hearing what's going on get the latest updates so we can update all of you um what the situation is this is where Haley winow is and I believe Haley was at Will Roger State Beach so I guess we're back there as far as the briefing is concerned that's where we're going to get the update um look at that yeah the wind I mean really these live images are so telling so telling the wind really picking up as we have been mentioning as Maria's been mentioning um we started off with 35 40 m hour winds and we're going to go up to 60 70 80 and that that that was the case up in the hills as it is but as uh we get to Nightfall those winds are only going to get stronger and the Situation's only going to become more dire it looks like it's getting worse as we speak with those palm trees really swing and you saw those flags blowing uh stronger than ever right there this is the intersection of Sunset and PCH again Sunset closed to traffic at this point and the situation really changing in terms of the atmosphere the visibility how dark it is how Gusty the winds are and we're looking at the small box at the live flame we've been monitoring from one vantage point and you can see just how close it is toty same house I believe it looks like a different house uh I'm not sure the location on that one we do know that there have been structures burned and destroyed again we're set up and ready for a news briefing at any time officials want to give us uh official word on what exactly the situation is at this point but again we're waiting to hear also from our reporters on the ground there they're fanned out at different locations trying to get their signals back to us to let us know what they're seeing uh on foot and on the ground through the area frustrating things and we heard from residents we were speaking with was the fact that um you know they had bad self service so it's tough to get updates and to stay connected when you're struggling to have service as it is and uh another complaint was that there was just conflicting information obviously when things are developing and it's a breaking new situation and things are changing by the second really um that can happen where things are conflicted and it it does add to the frustration of course when you're trying to figure out well what do I do right do I go here or do I go there is this safer or is that safer so it's been a um stressful frustrating day that is for sure so many schools uh closed canel or kids were asked to get picked up early obviously um for their own s safety and for the fact that for their own health as well the air quality is just looking at these images it's even hard to breathe watching this right it's it's tough out there so you're definitely going to be feeling uh the impact of this even if you're not in the immediate um danger zone um we were seeing images of that smoke and that air quality all the way in the South Bay a plume of smoke just very clear um so definitely avoid being outside if you can today let's see we are getting some fresh video in here one of the vehicles on fire this is a as a result of um possibly Embers which fly around get trapped um underneath the vehicle in the vehicles this happens often with um the attic or the eaves of a home you'll often see Embers just flying around and before you know it you've got an explosion of fire and you saw that line of cars there those cars abandoned this is a long PCH earlier in the morning and people leaving their cars ditching them where they were and then choosing to walk with all of their equipment their pets their belongings some people biking just to get out of the area you see the guy filling up his tire with air and then taking off on two wheels others without anything just decid to walk and saying walking is the best option I don't know if we mentioned this before but just to mention it again Santa Monica City officials say the westbound Santa Monica freeway at the 10 freeways being closed at Lincoln Boulevard along with Northbound Pacific Coast Highway to assist with evacuation efforts from the fire so it's certainly impacting a lot of communities along PCH and the surrounding areas as as well not just the Palisades but look at this devastating Flames really threatening the homes and properties of so many people it's hard to watch so um according to watch Duty which is a helpful tool and resource if you don't have that or follow that you can get that as an app watch Duty or go online go to watch duty. org and uh you get up upto-date information regarding um whatever fire is in your vicinity so it looks like we're at 770 close to 772 Acres Burnt at this point uh but we're going to get that official update as much as we can from fire officials uh Haley is at Will Roger State Beach that's where she's been since she got there on scene that is where they're setting up the command post to give us some information let's check in with her and see when we'll get some more information some up-to-date information hey guys we're hoping pretty soon we're waiting for mayor Karen bass who is supposed to lead this press conference but we've got a lot of First Responders pulling into Will Rogers State Beach um as this Wildfire continues to grow to nearly 800 acres I've got another dear friend on the line right now so we introduced you earlier to Eric Robertson this is his wife Trisha centino and they tried to get out and now they are literally trapped Trisha thanks for letting us know what's going on from your perspective I know you're kind of the thick of it what's happening yeah it is um it is very very terrifying up here we have one road leading out of the canyon Palisades Drive and it is leave at your own risk and we I I attempted I put the animals in the car got my son in the car even picked up a hitchhiker we were surrounded by flames on all sides there was Smoke everywhere and I made a u-turn and came back up the hill because I was afraid to drive through it so we're stuck here describe what it was like when you were driving out you said there was flames on both sides tell me what that was like like what you were seeing and what was going through your head so the canyon itself is um it has a little bit of unstable land so the the Rocks um that are normally behind Barrios there's all sorts of rocks that have now crumbled onto the road itself so it's even a little bit hard to drive there is smoldering um there's Ash there's um literally just within a foot or two of the road itself the Flames are coming all the way down it was I have never been so terrified in my entire life um why didn't you guys leave well the traffic ahead of us was flowing down and quite frankly this amount of smoke that we were heading into I was afraid that we wouldn't be able to breathe in the car but this morning it was It was kind of too late I guess right I guess you didn't realize how we got to the home yeah I mean this has happened before we've always been able to leave um we thought it would be okay I mean from my patio right now the this it looks like we're in a war zone that's yeah that's what it feels like here on Will Roger State Beach and I'm nowhere near where you are in the thick of it it's crazy and I mean everyone's obviously on edge I can't imagine what it's like for you guys up there it is terrifying I'm trying to not break down so that my kid thinks that everything is okay but it does not feel okay a what does he think about all this he's terrified I'm so sorry it's really bad I'm so sorry theyve sent a bunch of videos we've um we've included some of those on our air you've probably seen them um it really does look like a war zone Trish is there anything else you want to say before I let you go no no I I guess not um everybody needs to just do what they can and stay safe all right thank you well you guys please stay safe thank you all right thank you Trish so and I'm watching videos and listening to radio transcripts on citizen app and then of course watch Duty we told you about that app earlier that's really good to get up to the minute uh information and of course the Radio Calls kind of letting us know what's going on as well on citizen app but um from what I've read and what I've listened to it sounds like um they just now have deployed to help a smoke inhalation case that Force responders helped a 94y old woman out of a town home uh with you know has vision problems and uh mobility issues they were trying to get her out more than a dozen homes affected including a town home um and Trisha where she and Eric live I mean they they're literally like the road is closed and then they thought it was open that's when she and her son went down there to try to get out um and now they're safe she said they're safer in their home than they than they were you know then they are trying to to leave so um a lot of roads closed as you've heard an evacuation order now for all of Pacific Palisades go ahead I'm haly I didn't catch if Trisha's home is threatened did she feel like I know she said she's safer inside but how close are the Flames to her home well that's what I asked I'm like aren't you worried your house is going to burn down with you inside it and I mean she said yes but they're safer from her perspective where they are now than trying to leave I mean I know that she didn't expect it obviously probably like most people to get this bad I mean they um you know I've been talking to them kind of all morning they were they were the very first people who um told me at least about the fire um when it very first happened so I've been you know of course trying to tell them to get out but um it's just like anything else like these wildfires especially with these winds it just picks up so quickly and then if they don't get a hold of it in 20 minutes then all of a sudden it you know uh you know cannonballs from 20 acres I think it was to 200 and now nearly 800 but um yeah I mean she even said like most people I think are thinking is that they've been through this before they've always been able to get out um and you know I've been to their house it's really nice I mean a lot of people obviously we know the Palisades area a lot of really nice homes there celebrities homes threatened of course um but you know then there's the 94y old woman who can barely see walk that's trying to get out um and the apartment complex so um it's just like my stomach's in nuts and I'm not even you know anywhere near it or affected by it directly so I just can't imagine what it's like for them it really does even on the ground here you guys just off PCH at Will Roger State beach at the command post feels like a war zone here so I can only imagine what it looks and feels like up there yeah well you know what happens is when people have gone through and so many of the residents there they've gone through many fires and have lived there for years they um sometimes it works against them because they're like well we've done this we know the drill like it's a routine thing and it's not because you never know how the fire is going to behave and and uh my heart goes out to her and her family and hopefully they'll be okay obviously um because now at this point they don't really have a choice right in the morning they did and at this point they don't so uh keep us posted Haley I know you're going to be cool common Collective yes I she is so to hear that in her voice was you know um she obviously got a big heart I don't know if you heard her at the beginning it was kind of hard but she picked up a hitchhiker on the way out trying to get everybody out and you know obviously that's you know the epitome of these communities as we've seen in Malibu and in Camaro um and of course in woy and I'm hoping we're going to get started soon so we're guessing around three that's not definitive um but I know mayor Karen bass is going to be here obviously it takes a lot to get anywhere right now um and and as you guys have seen and talked about you know at least 100 people walking um because uh their cars are on fire or the traffic's too bad or whatever the situation is sure it takes a while to get here because there's 100 abandoned vehicles so who knows how many people were in each of those vehicles and this this is such a long event too it's not like you know a two-day Santa Ana wind event I mean we really are start this was not supposed to be you know this isn't even the worst of it it's going to peak tonight and then you know we're still going to have big ons even on Friday even though they may not be Red Flag Warning conditions so well we're going to continue to follow this we're going to let you go so you can get set up so we can take that uh news briefing as soon as it gets going please keep in touch with your friend of course trishan and then we'll check in and see how they're doing uh I think we are going to head over and check in with Christy Fardo who's at tascal and sunset I'm going to hand it over to Mara who just came in and Sandra they'll continue the coverage as we continue to bring you the latest information with this Palisades fire that's really exploded in the last 4 hours roxia thank you so much so the clock just is tells us it's just after 2:30 this means that this Palisades fire has been burning for more than 4 hours now I'm Marla teas joining the coverage alongside Sandra Endo we have reporters scattered throughout the Palisades area of course to keep you up to date you can get the latest information on our website too it's foxla.com we know that this fire has now burned close to 800 acres homes have burned we've seen vehicles on fire kids obviously have been evacuated from local schools as well and the worst is yet to come I think we should just go ahead and check in with our chief meteorologist Adam Krueger now for the latest on when those winds are going to even get worse yeah I mean so we're looking at tonight and into tomorrow morning for for this whole event to come to a peak with even stronger wind gust than what we've seen so far and yes our coverage has been focused a lot on the Pacific Palisades area but also you know the entire Southern California area is basically looking at these very strong winds high wind warning is in effect until 600 p.m. tomorrow so that gives you some idea of the extent to which we're going to be facing some of these strongest winds I do have a Graphic here that will walk you through the forecast wind gust as we go hour by hour so let's look at that now as we start at 3:00 this afternoon and again keep in mind this is a forecast it might not play out exactly like this but it's going to give us a good idea of what's going on and first of all you'll notice the winds moving from the Northeast I've got the Pacific Palisades plotted right here so the winds are pushing the smoke towards the the coast we've seen the gust in this area and you could tell from the video it's strong but uh the weather stations around there measuring about 20 to 40 mph gusts you get into the mountains a little west of the Palisades and gusts have been even higher today but let's go through this now a little bit later so we expect a slight downturn later on this evening this is a look at 6 p.m. today but don't let your guard down at this point this is just going to be a little kind of a whoosh of maybe a an onshore wind briefly and then it switches right back around to some stronger offshore winds as we go later into tonight so here's a look at 88 p.m. again there's the Palisades Gust in the 50s according to this model at midnight it's suggesting gust near 60 we go later into the night and early in the morning it says gust could be reaching 70 plus milph in or around the palisad so this is again kind of the peak late tonight early tomorrow morning as we continue through the day tomorrow here's 10:00 a.m. still very w but you start seeing the numbers go down a little bit and then as we go through the day Wednesday I'll pause it at 6 p.m. which this is the point at which the high wind warnings expire yes it's still going to be Breezy yes we still see offshore Santa Ana winds but the worst of this uh in terms of the weather will be done by the end of the day tomorrow now another issue is we know the air is dry with the San Ana winds going on right now but tomorrow's humidity will be even lower than the already dry air we see today I was just checking a weather station near the Palisades measuring relative humidity right now between about 20 and 30% and a lot of the areas around 10 to 20% today watch as we go into tomorrow and you're going to see these numbers drop off midday tomorrow will bring it to noon on Wednesday a lot of 10% or less relative humidity so even dryer tomorrow even stronger winds tonight into tomorrow morning it's already a serious situation and if uh you know another fire starts it could be even more serious this particular fire that we're following it may be just really really difficult for firefighters to handle we you know it's going to be difficult with just how strong the winds are and how dry the air is uh one more thing I want to share with you now and and kind of fitting with the video we're showing right here is the air quality and unfortunately there's not a air quality sensor right in the path of where we're seeing some of the smoke from this Palisades fire so notice there's some green and yellow dots which indicates good to moderate air quality around the LA area areas East as well uh so again I can't really pin down exactly what the air quality is like right near the fire but we know it's not good and again that smoke is blowing towards the ocean from the palisad so kind of missing places like Santa Monica Brentwood maybe you're smelling the smoke a little bit but it's not like the smoke is going right over you and wind should pretty much continue in a similar Direction mostly out of the Northeast throughout a lot of this event so that's kind of the latest we have right now Mara again we knew this was coming we were hoping there wasn't going to be a fire uh but it seems obviously one has panned out and we we know just these weather conditions are about as Extreme as it gets both in terms of the strength of the wind and how dry the air is as well Mara back to you as Adam was mentioning you could certainly see a shift in how this uh fire has really reacted and uh Marla we've been covering this since 10:30 this morning and obviously now the worst is yet to come let's check in with Christy Fardo who is still with all the people trying to get out of the area we could see the traffic behind you Christie yeah there's still quite a bit of traffic but it is moving a lot faster in fact we talked to one woman who told us it only took her 3 minutes to get here here from bi Venita and she we spoke to someone earlier who told us it took us them two hours but just a short while ago there was someone who was stuck in this traffic who actually flagged us down he said that he had come from ELO and that there were four homes on fire as he was leaving that is why he finally opted to evacuate it seems like most people evacuated earlier which is why we're seeing traffic moving a little better there's also Now traffic control at Tesco Canyon and sunset but if we pound up to that Hillside you can see how close the Flames are now getting to tascal Canyon Road which is why that one woman who told us it only took her 3 minutes to get here decided to evacuate she started to see those flames and we hear so much about how fires create their own weather and she said she saw evidence of that she said suddenly there were these gusts and Flames whipping around and she said she' never seen anything like that but she knew then that it was not to stay so she decided to evacuate but there are still some people where we are that are Milling about and who are staying inside their Condominiums and apartments and also workers there's construction workers who are still working I went up to them and I asked them why they hadn't evacuated and they told us they were waiting on orders from their boss they said they have to earn a living so they're going to stay here until they're told to leave and so far no one has told them but I can tell you driving in we are getting uh those alerts telling you that you are entering an evacuation Zone and I'm starting to hear some aircraft going over us short while ago we actually saw the dc10 which indicates that it is still flying still making water and retardant drops despite the heavy gusts uh right where we are again not seeing those gusts but the woman that we spoke with telling us that she did right before she decided to evacuate so still very very much a factor and you can see people still streaming out but at least now they're moving let's send it back to you christe will you pinpoint your exact location we're on Sunset and tamascal Canyon Boulevard and you know I should mention that there were some people who opted because traffic was so backed up to go on foot we saw a man walking out with uh a suitcase and then there was a woman who was actually running with three children she told us she had come from vien Venita and she decided to go on foot because her baby is at home and was frantic to get home to that child oh just it's heartbreaking to see the images of people who are saying the the best option for them is to walk and you're leaving everything behind your vehicle in our car driven you know City that we live in nobody walks there's no public transportation and they opted to walk see given that that's the best option for them thank you chrisy but uh clearly from where her vantage point is it's great that there's aerial assets that are attacking the Flames from that position because look at this from Sunset and PCH a very different view you can see the Gusty winds and the change in in atmosphere because of that fire and smoke so Christy seems like she's on the other side of where the wind is blowing and at least maybe they can tackle the Flames from there let's take a look at some video that we had a little bit earlier this was really intense when Matthew seedorf was on the scene and I remember seeing this live when I was watching from home uh you can just see the wind gust you see those FL surrounding that two-story home again that's the bigger picture here the smaller picture that is alive look at Sunset and PCH but here we go with the bigger picture and just the flames and the spotfires that pop up I mean we know that Embers can be carried for 1 to two miles and we are absolutely seeing that and that is why this fire has exploded as it has since 10:30 this morning so more than 4 hours into this almost 800 acres earned and uh is that Matthew himself that is he grabbed a garden host sprung into action in his live report he was saying that a lot of residents in the area were concerned and as was he that there were no fire crews in the area yet some property damage was taking place so he took it upon himself he grabbed a a fire hose or a garden hose rather and put out some of those fires that that we're seeing right there but again this is what fire officials say don't do do not try this at home don't hunker down don't don't think that you can fight this fire with a garden hose yeah I mean Matthew just covered and we should remind our viewers probably don't need reminding that not long ago it was the Malibu fire the Franklin fire that erupted that uh started late in the afternoon and into the night into our coverage that picked up on Good Day LA and Matthew was out there kind of doing the same thing so helping out where we can uh so we have two live pictures this is Christy Fardo the bigger picture of course that's Sunset and tascal and then we're waiting for a press conference in the smaller box that's at the staging area at Will Rogers State Beach time has not officially been announced yet but Haley winow she's been staged there and she tells us that she got word it should happen around 3:00 so lafd uh will be leading that press conference but since I do live on the west side near uh the station I will say that when I was out earlier I was seeing Culver City fire um other agents pass on through trying to get there also to help so this is an all handson deck uh firefight the Palisades fire it's not just lafd we know that Bay Area Crews were called in and they were sent down yesterday in the day before to Stage for this life-threatening event and this isn't doesn't happen often it's just happened to have happened more often of late uh in Southern California beginning with the Franklin fire and then prior to that it was the Ventura County fire that we covered too that was really devastating to that neighborhood so here we go again with these lifethreatening fire conditions and we're seeing the result of all of that as people are trying to get out when we talk about evacuations bottom line if you live in Pacific Palisades you are under an evacuation order it's now or it could be never and we don't want you to be in that situation that's right and we are waiting to hear from mayor Karen bass who will be joining the fire officials at Will Rogers State beach with the official update on what exactly is happening and they're going to give numbers in term of total acreage that has burned but so far it's nearly 800 acres again this fire breaking out at 10:30 uh again now we're hearing Karen bass will not be at the press conference uh originally there was a report that she was going to be there but not anymore well now we are hearing uh Governor Gavin new in fact will be at that presser so Gavin Nome uh in town he will be there at the uh Palisades fire press conference it could start any minute now we're hearing from Haley Winslow again this could start at 3 it should also be of note that President Biden and First Lady Joe Biden they flew in they landed at LAX last night at 9:30 they were just going to spend the night to then go to uh Riverside County uh to take part in creating two more national monuments that whole trip was canel because of the situation here and because of the high winds so he was doing remarks virtually instead of heading to Riverside County as a result so the latest information that we just received is that possibly around 3:00 Governor Gavin Newsome will be there with lafd officials to update us on the Palisades fire burning at almost 800 acres we do have new sound or an interview from someone at the scene um regarding the situation let's listen into this new piece of uh sound I hope we don't lose the whole neighborhood yeah it's horrible and it's horrible to see the hillsides burning too it's going to be really sad because Tanga State Park and a lot of people recreate in this area too it's going to be really horrible and you say you walk through here so what is what is up there like well there where you can see the smoke there up to the Flames all the way back there is a neighborhood with a street that loops around right up by those flames and comes around so it's all just homes on the hillside wow so she's talking about all the trails and the hiking recreation resources all in that area where neighbors and and residents enjoy it's one of the perks of living in the Palisades as well as the proximity to show the ocean and the views there uh uh a lot of residents we were listening to you know say that that is what draws them to this community it is a tight-nit community they are aware of it being fir prone given uh the hillsides and the canyons and the Santa Monica Mountains right there but it is a beautiful place to live and residents really feeling for the fact that now look at all the damage being left behind because of this yeah and no word yet on actual numbers of structures that have been lost but again we've seen houses on fire we've seen vehicles on fire and this view from Sky Fox is really daunting to see that big plume of smoke which can be seen from basically anywhere uh on the west side of course of Los Angeles but beyond this plume is that massive in terms of evacuation centers we've told you earlier that the Westwood rec center on suula Boulevard near between Ohio and Wilshire that is open for evacuees they also accept small animals and then also in addition to that evacuation Center uh I've just been alerted uh that the Dream Center in Hollywood the Dream Center this is on bellw Avenue 2301 bellw Avenue the Dream Center is now opening as an evacuation Center for anyone who needs a place to stay who needs food who needs water who needs any sort of help it is open 24/7 again the Dream Center has been added to the evacuation Center list for the Palisades fire so that is of course uh good news when this started this morning though Sandra I know that you were on the air uh as we give you a look at the evacuation order uh map there's some areas that are still in warning the yellow areas and then the red predominantly evacuation order this started as one of those you know small brush fires that we hear about but we knew given the forecast and the destructive winds we knew that this could really in fact become a reality and it has and that's exactly what happened it started 10:30 a small vegetation fire reported 10 acres that were burned and then just in a matter of 20 minutes or so doubled tripled in size quickly became 200 Acres we were holding at that for quite some time because of the fact though that the number of acres is a lagging indicator it's the number that we get at the very end they're not assessing how big this fire has spread as they're fighting the fire it's the last thing they're doing so the number we get is usually outdated by the time we report it so we were holding at 200 for uh quite some time and then obviously just looking at these images seeing the winds really drive this fire and the smoke and surrounding the community and seeing how quickly it was spreading we knew right away that this was going to be a massive fire event driven by the winds and clearly the latest update we got nearly 800 acres burn so tripling in size over the uh past few hours or so and clearly that's not the latest numbers we have we're going to get that in just about 10 minutes or so as we wait for fire officials and the governor to give us the latest numbers on this but you can just see the devastation that it is already created look at those structures people's homes and livelihoods on fire up in flames and the fact the traumatic events of people abandoning their cars walking on foot with their precious belongings trying to get to safety this is just not how you want to start off the new year no not at all and here's when I said that we've seen vehicles on fire here's an example uh right here uh the other pretty staggering image that I saw earlier s you can tell me if if this is right or wrong uh is it a super scooper that I actually saw in the Pacific Ocean yeah that was amazing to see backtack super scoopers literally Landing in the Pacific not far obviously from the Palisades to load up all of those gallons of water to be able to fight the fire so there is an air assault on this but as those winds pick up it's a question of if that air those aircraft that are ever so helpful if they will be able to fly and those super scoopers by the way they can hold up to 1600 gallons of water but that that can do a tremendous amount in terms of aiding in the firefight yeah these images from the ground to see these people just there it is that's what you're talking about yeah I saw this earlier and I thought my goodness you know thank goodness that this is so close mhm and this was a really dramatic scene as we saw one after another them scooping up the water from the Pacific Ocean right there making these dramatic drops on top of the flames this was the window of opportunity we're talking about to make progress to really fight this fire before those high winds kick up and again we're looking at about two more hours of daylight and Max winds picking up so of course they wanted to make progress on this as quickly as possible we saw them one after another making drops in a heroic fashion getting right on top of those Flames it was quite amazing to see them at work and then of course they had to be grounded for refueling and it's just a matter of time before those winds get too Gusty for them to fly and that's the big problem that they're going to contend with especially uh as it gets later into the evening and soon you know visibility is an issue as well this all started in terms of an actual location for those of you who are very local and know where this is this is at 1190 North padra Mora Drive that's where that first call came in at 10:30 this morning for word of a brush fire amidst these destructive winds that will only pick up uh as we get later into the afternoon and evening although listening to Adam he did say that there would be a little bit of a reprieve later but not much uh but just given the devastation obviously the firefight uh is a really precarious one unable to fly if those winds get those wind guests get up too high uh the hand crews are out there of course but in terms of surrounding this fire it is a very very tall order as we're looking live uh at just those active Flames that are ferocious let's in fact bring in Adam Krueger right now to talk more about those wind speeds the wind gust the stained speeds I know you have all that information handy and this is going to last you said until 600 p.m. tomorrow Wednesday right we've got the high wind warning in effect until 6 P p.m. Wednesday so that gives you an idea of the length of time here that we're going to be dealing with the most intense winds now yes as far as you said Mara accurate that we're going to find the winds maybe around 5 or 600 p.m. today just back off slightly around the Palisades area still going to be strong in many other parts of Southern California but that is a very brief uh window where they back down then the winds start picking up as we go a little later into the evening I think it's possible we find gust back over 50 or so maybe by about 9 or 10:00 tonight around the Palisades and then just overall around a lot of Southern California as we continue towards midnight wind speeds will continue to ramp up especially kind of West North and Northeast of Los Angeles so the mountains valleys and of course over towards the Palisades as well so through the night tonight is probably going to be the highest wind speeds we will have seen out of this whole event that lasts through about sunrise tomorrow and then wind speeds still very strong through a lot of the morning gradually backing down tomorrow afternoon and then falling below high wind warning criteria by about 600 p.m. tomorrow uh I know we have the graphic up right there I'm going to back it up and just kind of show you once again so here's a look at 600 p.m. today you see the Palisades listed with some lower winds around that time here we go into uh 8:00 p.m. wind speeds picking up and again note the direction out of the north now we're at midnight tonight here we go into 7:00 a.m. tomorrow doesn't mean there's going to be 70 mph gust into the Palisades but our model is saying that is within the realm of possibility at that time there's a look at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow still very strong winds and then wrapping it up here at 6 or 7:00 tomorrow evening we see a better sight but keep in mind it's still quite Gusty in some areas at this time there's still an offshore Santa Ana wind at that time there's still very dry air and something I mentioned earlier I'll say again is that the air as dry as it is today actually gets even drier tomorrow with some spots possibly seeing relative humidities tomorrow below 10% which also coincides with basically when the strongest winds will be happening so weather condition wise I mean it's it is going to get worse before it gets better the better part of that will be late day Wednesday but still you know we've got red flag warnings that continue into Thursday we can't let our guard down and until really the end of this week Adam as we're looking live at what appears to be a home that is completely destroyed by Flames when you talk about the 72 mph wind gusts that are forecast about 7: a.m. tomorrow I know this may seem like an obvious question but put that into context into perspective on how dangerous and rare that is I mean it is very rare and it's just kind of the way things have gone this season and and we've seen the images from the Mountain Fire uh and the Franklin fire the the extreme fire conditions this is actually now the third extreme situation we've had this season so going year by year it's rare to have a situation like that happens to be the third such event though this season we had one in November one in December here we are with one in January and I'll mention uh kind of for some more context on your question we mentioned yesterday and and also earlier today as well that this is a not a standard Red Flag Warning it's a particularly dangerous situation Red Flag Warning it's a tag the National Weather Service will give These Warnings just to emphasize at the fact that it's a rare extreme event they started doing this in 2020 one of these these PDS red flag warnings was issued in 2020 and then we didn't have another one until just this past November and then last month in December and then again here in January so three of them this season uh but yes I mean the winds gusting 60 to 70 is possible in the Palisades late tonight tomorrow morning we know what the Embers can do in a situation like that they can fly a mile or two ahead of where the actual fire is and then you know we we look at this video here yes it's windy but imagine the winds almost double what you're seeing right here and it's just going to be such an extreme circumstance where the uh the crews will be doing what they can but really to put a good dent in in keeping things safe around where these fires are there's not a whole lot you can do when the weather is that extreme when the winds are that strong when the air is this dry uh I mean they're going to do what they can but you know there's not a whole lot they can do I would imagine until really things settle down a little bit later on this week and you're looking at new video of other property damage that we're getting into to our Newsroom this is just so heartbreaking to see and the fact that this fire really broke out in a populous area initially obviously it didn't start that way but given that the Palisades is such a dense Community when you talk about the people living there we saw multi-unit apartment complexes the roof up in flames and now we're getting a closer look at some of the property damage people's livelihoods their homes Up in Flames just destroyed because of the Palisades fire and again new footage coming into our Newsroom this video for the first time we're seeing the number of structures that have been impacted by this Adam and Mara this is just so heartbreaking to see but again we are awaiting word from fire officials to give us exact numbers CU we want to know how many structures in total have been damaged or destroyed from this and also where they are so many times when we cover fires like this people are asking us since we're the news crews out there what street are you on what's the exact address they want to know since they've evacuated from these areas if their home is still standing yeah and this word from lafd as well saying that there are over 250 lfd firefighters in addition to neighboring agencies there and then approximately 30 vehicles that were left abandoned on Sunset and Palisades they will be moved by County Dozer to provide clear access so you're talking about how we've seen those images of people literally huffing it out on foot having to abandon their car out of fright and out of the fact that they literally were not moving uh those Vehicles will be moved by County Dozer to provide clear access for those firefighting Crews emergency officials and 30 Vehicles just in that area alone there have been reports of 100 vehicles or more that have been abandoned in various locations in total so we're not just talking about that one strip of uh roadway right there but there other thorough fars like Sunset and tuscal that have been impacted and inundated with traffic of people trying to leave the area pretty hopeless given the fact that they're willing to abandon their own vehicles and then as you mentioned just leave by foot and so those cars will have to be dealt with as well we don't know if they're going to be towed or or what in this situation but clearly the road you were mentioning Mara is a main thoroughfare for First Responders to get to and that that was the big issue being able to get those emercy vehicles to and from the locations that they need to fight this fire so we're seeing that live picture there it's shaky um understandably so you see those active Flames all the homes in the foreground the flames in the background and then this picture from now we're taking this fool here so you can just see how anous ominous pardon me and and and scary this image is and this is from our Santa Monica cam we show this camera to you all the time but it's flipped around and we show you the coastline we show you the Malibu Coastline and we obviously show you the Santa Monica Pier but now we flipped it around and you can see the Palisades homes there on the hillside and then those Flames that are now shooting upward with all of that black smoke we've heard from people in Agora Hills that say we can see the the black smoke we've heard from people of course on the West Side uh in downtown uh this is impacting the Greater Los Angeles area even though it is centered here in Pacific Palisade so again we are waiting this press conference from lfd and we've gotten word that Governor Gavin Newsome will be there at that press conference to update us on the latest in terms of acreage and uh forc evacuations and number of structures lost although I'm sure they don't have that count yet let's go to Christy Fardo on the ground there she's at Sunset Tes school if you haven't moved christe we have not moved but you know what has traffic in fact if we pan this way you can see that the street is now empty and that is because most people evacuated earlier and now we're only starting to see some scraggler some of the strugglers some of the those that waited till the last minute and I told you in the last live shot that there was a man who told us that as he was leaving medo or El medo he saw four homes on fire we've heard other people walking by on the phone talking about how their neighbor homes had burned so a lot of Devastation sadly out here and a short while ago we saw a woman who had actually come to try to get in to evacuate her elderly father she told us that he has Alzheimer's and gets very agitated so he won't just go with anyone the problem is she did not have an ID that had that address on it so she couldn't get there luckily though the LAPD here worked with her and eventually did let her in and she was in tears as she was driving to get her father she told us that he has lived there for 70 years he's now in his '90s and she just wanted to go and get him and know that he is safe and in the last hour we've seen these Flames get closer and closer to Tesco Canyon Road which is where we are at the corner of Sunset and about an hour ago there was bumper-to-bumper traffic as people were fleeing the Flames uh traffic control came in but as I said most people had opted to evacuate earlier and I also just spoke to a woman who told me she got the evacuation order she Liv lives in the neighborhood you see over there where the where all the smoke is which is something over there is currently burning um she told me that she got the evacuation order at 10:30 and she left then so she had a bag with her but uh she's been standing here on Sunset just watching and hoping it doesn't reach her home as far as she can tell it looks like it's still burning above her neighborhood not right in her neighborhood so she's hoping that the winds shift directions and that the Flames blow back from where they just burn through that would be the best case scenario but a lot of very anxious people here we also saw a woman who came to the roadblock who was also desperate to get through she says she was trying to get to her husband who was up the road whose leg is in a cast so he can't drive and he can also not walk out uh LAPD was also working with her to try to get her to her husband so that's what we're seeing at this hour a lot of very anxious people people a lot of stress and unfortunately a lot of flames as well let's send it back to you so many terrifying personal stories you're hearing out there Christie thank you so much welcoming to our coverage we have Alex Michaelson now good to have you thank you so much our thanks to Sandra Endo who's been on this air for several hours is now uh been relieved and I'll pick up the coverage with Mara uh for the foreseeable future here on Fox 11 if you're just joining us a massive fire in Pacific Palisades we warn about this last night when we were talking about the forecast uh that if there was a fire that broke out at any point it could get very big very fast unfortunately that happened this fire breaking out around 10:30 this morning has just exploded uh we know that several structures are involved uh and uh this Flames can be seen for miles and miles in so many different directions we want to make sure our viewers know that if you can't be sitting down in front of a television you can always find the latest information on our app it's the fox Local app it is a wealth of information especially in an emergency situation like this you can find out the latest acreage the evacuation centers we have all the latest information from officials and we will be of course streaming there live as well so as soon as we get the latest information from lafd as soon as they take to that Podium they're staged at the uh Will Rogers State Beach that is the staging area then we will bring that to you and that will be included there you can see right there on your screen the fox Local app and you can just if you don't have it yet you can use that QR code right now with your phone to download that it is very useful again especially in an emergency life or death situation like we're seeing today in the Palisades it is free and you can watch it anytime not only just during emergencies but really especially helpful today uh let's check in with Haley Winslow right now um she is joining us live at Will Rogers State Beach we just saw some video from Governor Nome tweeting out just a few minutes ago I was just in communication with his team I know he is there uh he was supposed to be here to meet with President Biden today um but now he's there Haley yeah we're expecting this press conference to start with him in about a half hour he's going to speak and we were originally told Karen bass as well but she will not be here she's out of the country but it will be one of her Deputy Mayors Zach Sidell who's also her PR person but my friend who we just had on the air I think said it best that it feels and looks like a war zone and she's in the thick of it but I can tell you down here even at the command post it looks and feels the exact same way so I can't imagine what it's like for them up there it's just uh looking at the latest updates and right now firefighters are trying to rescue somebody inside of a home but we do have a few new videos I just got from two different friends one is Trisha who we introduced you to about 20 minutes ago friend of mine who is trapped in their home they tried to leave and they have fire on both sides she I just talked to her again and she she said you know I'm never terrified and I'm terrified um she's got her son there her and her husband and they are just trying to figure out what to do they can't get out um the roads are obviously closed and then we also have another video from a friend in Santa Monica so he's shooting right off of Channel Road he's on Adelaide and you can see the fire moving south um it's really unbelievable I mean how and you can see active Flames obviously we've got a lot of emergency vehicles coming in here getting ready for this press conference a lot of moving parts so we're right here at lifeguard operations on Will Rogers uh State Beach here right off of the PCH it has been chaotic to say the least really um a a wild a wild day um and obviously this is only the beginning so you can see the sky I would say that's the most impressive um just how ominous it looks and the wind gusts every once in a while will almost knock you off your feet and they're not they haven't even really been that strong considering what's to come um but yeah we've got a lot of First Responders from Orange County to Los Angeles to LA County um a lot of police officers just filing in here it's taking a bit you guys as you can imagine to get here for them um the traffic was a nightmare it's finally moving now um but we've seen just you can't really see it anymore because you can't even make out the Santa Monica Mountains but um you were just a few minutes ago you could see active Flames just right down the road from here basically so to show that the fire is spreading to now more than 800 acres so um as soon as this presser starts we will of course let you know right away so that you can tune in and hear the very latest and we're expecting that in the hopefully 20 minutes yeah I I know it's busy there and of course when that happens we'll bring that to our viewers live and now this is this is a really sad devastating live picture here and you can see the firefight of this beautiful home twostory home it looks like I I don't have an exact location maybe I can we can get that uh where this live camera is in the Palisades but obviously this home is at this point looking like a potential total loss as the fire Crews there lafd they're scrambling to put out those flames and Alex if you can see obviously the the flames shooting through that Second Story but on the back of the house you wonder a adjacent to it and then if there's another home in the backyard that one Ember it just needs to just jump one roof to the next and you know there you have an entire block on fire and as we so often talk about fires create their own weather patterns but then you look at how intense the winds are anyways um and this thing isn't close to being out uh that you just feel for uh this family and you think about all of their memories and likely the pictures and everything that goes with somebody's home as we you know having some signal challenges because as you know cell signal in that area is already bad you now um have all this you know destruction happening which is um interfering with a lot of our cellular towers all the rest of it making getting the pictures out of there uh difficult but you can see this even from Miles Away um that line of flame um that is in the middle of one of the most picturesque areas in all of Southern California um a really just beautiful uh area that people from around the world think of Southern California and uh and unfortunately it is now burning yeah not far from where you and I both covered the Franklin fire in Malibu uh weeks ago if if you check the calendar maybe even a month ago but it it was really recent and then before that we had the fire in in Ventura County as well which was absolutely devastating with hundreds of homes lost and that was also uh one of those very rare uh particularly dangerous events uh as described by the National Weather Service so look at this plume of smoke that we're seeing we haven't had rain measurable rain I know Adam can correct me uh I I believe since May yeah I mean early May first week of May there was a decent amount it was still less than an inch um since miday officially in downtown Los Angeles it's been .16 in uh and that's about 8 months so you know that's about as dry as it gets a A near record dry a stretch of weather for us so no surprise the vegetation very dry um you you know we unfortunately going through November and especially December as we saw storm system after storm system miss us off to the north northern California seeing plenty of wet weather through this rainy season just nothing making it down towards us and so yeah just extremely dry vegetation the stage was set not just in terms of how dry it's been for months but also the weather setup with this uh scenario and for anyone who just joined you know recently I'll reiterate what we said earlier is that the winds as strong as they've been will get stronger tonight after the sun goes down but especially after about 8 or 9:00 tonight from that that point through about 8 9 10:00 tomorrow morning that whole stretch right there about 12 hours the winds will be at their Peak out of this event and we could potentially According to some models see some wind gusts 60 to maybe even 70 mph in or around the Pacific Palace which will be higher than we've had so far so you already a very tough situation weatherwise will get more difficult as we go through tomorrow and those high wind warnings they expire at 6:00 p.m. tomorrow so that gives us a little sense at when the worst of this weatherwise is done still Santa Ana winds though to some degree will be hanging around through Thursday in a lot of Southern California as well all right Adam thank you well of course first and foremost in a firefight any firefight lafd the firefighters they always want to save live first and then property so uh you know we haven't heard of any injuries it's obviously too soon uh so that is at this point really great news unfortunately we've seen and so many homes that have gone up and then images like this from earlier of cars that were just sort of left abandoned this is a live picture in fact wow that I mean we we overuse that phrase this looks like a war zone but that looks like a horror movie right I mean when you think about that you some of those movies where the cars are abandoned and everybody has to get out quickly that looks like that image right there well to paint a more clear picture this is what I was referring to earlier that lafd said any abandoned cars we're going to have to bulldoze your cars to clear access for the fire fight so at one point they may have just been in a single file and now they've been bulldozed to be pushed to the side so all of these vehicles and at last count I mean lfg said in one spot was 30 Vehicles clearly there's a lot more um given this live picture as a photographer and thank you to whomever is behind the camera for taking us up this road uh and showing us the damage of this Audi obviously uh as we're seeing there the damage from the bulldozer on the side it looks like maybe a pet was in that vehicle as well we've heard a lot about that today too where people have gone out and looks like some groceries in in the back they had gone out to run an errand and then the fire began and they couldn't get back home and their pet was back at home and they couldn't get the pet looks like the lights are still on perhaps there or maybe that's just the glare that I'm seeing U but car after car after car it does look like Armageddon yeah and you feel for for all of those residents um and and man that's just awful awful to see but you understand I guess the the the need to get fire trucks up the these roads and try to save people's lives and ultimately you can replace a car but you can't replace somebody's life and um there is an urgent life or death fight I mean last night Adam Krueger was telling us the the phrase that they were putting out it was lifethreatening fire uh weather fire conditions and this is indeed what we're looking at this is a lifethreatening fire um and uh fortunately so far Marlo we do not have any reports of uh of any injuries or deaths because of this um it looks like that is probably a bed for a dog or a cat um but you know it it would not be shocking uh given what we're looking at right now if if we found out that there was you know a situation like that um based off of these conditions and we've seen a lot of elderly people too uh we heard from Christy Bardo that they were afraid to leave of course and and they weren't sure how to and fortunately neighbors or members were able to get to them and literally walking them out of their homes we've seen a lot of that want to bring into the conversation right now my pal Joel Pock who is a regular on our political show the issue is he's with Breitbart News but more importantly he's a Santa Monica resident and a husband and a father who lives in the middle of this neighborhood that has been evacuated uh Joel joins us now live Joel thanks for calling in first off how are you doing how's your family doing we are fine we're in Santa Monica right now but we actually live in the Palisades near where the fire is so we are feeling fortunate that we were able to leave in time but obviously we're very concerned for our neighbors in our neighborhood talk about what it was like when you were leaving what it looks like and and the vibe with the rest of your neighbors so our Nanny was walking our 3month old and smelled smoke at about 10:30 and sent my wife and I a text message saying that she smelled smoke and that it might be nearby so I said okay I'm coming home and I texted my wife and The Nanny and said let's just pack up in case we need to evacuate and I don't know exactly why because we've had high winds before and there have been wildfires somewhat nearby before but I had a feeling that this might be more serious as soon as I pulled on to PCH from Santa Monica I saw the column of smoke and realized right away this was going to be a very big fire and we packed everything up in about 15 minutes my wife went to the local school Marquez Charter which is an LA USD school to pick up one of our kids and we left when we were leaving the first fire engines were coming into the community from other communities they were setting up their positions and the traffic was starting to build up on Sunset and we were able to get out of the neighborhood but I understand that many others were not and people actually abandoned their cars along the side of Sunset Boulevard which made it even harder to evacuate so we feel fortunate that we got out in time but there really have to be some improvements in how we handle these situations because there should have been police directing traffic they should have issued an evacuation order a lot earlier than they did and there was a problem at the school where initially they were asking parents to fill out forms to take their kids out of school rather than just getting the kids out of school as soon as possible I don't think that we were prepared as a city for a fast moving Wildfire like this individually I think people did very well and as we were leaving we offered neighbors rides and people were in high spirits and they were cooperating but I think it happened so quickly that a lot of people were just unable to react and our systems as a city as a county and a state I guess or as a school district also they just weren't ready and that's that's the feeling a lot of us had that this really could have been handled better yeah I mean Joel Marl is here uh good to have you I'm sorry it's under these conditions we were just showing those images of the abandoned vehicles and uh we got word that at one point one of these roads and this may have been the one where it was literally curbed to curb of cars that were abandoned and to get access for the firefighters they had to use bulldozers to literally bulldo the stranded Vehicles off to the side so all of those vehicles are now damaged as a result glad you're safe any word on the Integrity of your home right now as it relates to where those Flames are our house unfortunately is directly in the path of the prior when we left it was about a half mile up the hill but we're not sure it's going to stay that way and we are anxiously checking cameras and things like that to see what happens we do want to thank all of the First Responders and firefighters who are out there trying to keep the neighborhood safe but unfortunately we know that some of the homes further up the hill have been damaged or destroyed and we're hoping that that doesn't happen but we are glad we have fire insurance which is also another issue more people need fire insurance in California but hopefully things will turn out for the best we're just glad that everybody in our family is safe and we're thinking of all the people who are still trying to get out uh you're the father of several young kids how do you talk about this with them well we just had to pick up one of our kids from preschool and we explained to her that we couldn't go home tonight because there is a fire near our house but we'll go home when it's over and the firefighters are going to put it out and she seemed Satisfied by that explanation and it's a bit of an adventure for them because they don't understand yet what's happening but our eldest who's at a different School heard from a classmate that her home had burnt down because the classmate's mother inadvertently called my daughter's phone instead of my wife and so my daughter who's 12 hand and hadn't heard about the fire and so went to the school office and called us and my wife had to calm her down so it's it's a challenge and lastly Joel you know as as a journalist yourself um who covers the news and and tries to cover the news somewhat dispassionately a lot of times what's it like now to be in the middle of a news story like this well this is never the kind of story you want to be in the middle of but we live in a state that has periodic droughts and whether you believe in climate change or not we have to manage a dry environment we had two wonderfully wet Winters the last two years but ironically that caused a lot of brush to grow and there hasn't been any rain this winter so far so there's a lot of fuel and it's very dry and we need to talk about how to be more careful about fire there's a suggestion it hasn't been proven yet but there's a suggesting from some neighbors that people had been setting off fireworks on New Year's Eve nearby and that caused a fire on New Year's Day that was put out but it's possible that the smoldering remnants of that fire ignited in these high winds there needs to be I think greater awareness of the danger of fireworks in these dry conditions and I think there are a lot of questions to ask of our public authorities including our schools about why we wanten better prepared for this but also we need to ask about how we can manage living in this environment more safely because this is going to be a risk for the foreseeable future Joe Pollock uh from Bright Bart news um our friend here at Fox 11 and and often guest on our political show the issue is for our first ever episode of the issue is uh Joel we're thinking about you and your family we hope your home turns out to be okay but we're glad most of all that you're all safe and that you're together uh and sending love to you all thank you very much and hope everyone else is also safe thanks so much we just got an update in terms of acreage and it's on your screen if you're looking at the screen this is from calire calire now estimates the Palisades fire is at 1,262 Acres so just a couple hours ago it was at 770 and now we're up to almost, 1300 Acres this picture this is a live picture from our Santa Monica camera this is from Ocean Boulevard the main drag right there along pch in the Pacific Ocean of course and it's high up there and we're seeing those Flames those active Flames the massive plume of smoke and then of course the foreground all of those homes that are under evacuation uh warnings and or orders we're expecting a press conference including the governor of California G Gavin Newsome in the next five minutes or so when that begins uh we will take you there live in the meantime we want to bring christe Fardo back into the conversation uh she's standing by Christy what are you seeing from your Vantage Point right now well we're actually at Sunset and Tesco Canyon and we just got a big gust of wind and it kicked up take a look here behind me all of the smoke and dust and Ash and it's stared to obscure Flames but that whole Hillside is on fire we've been watching as it gets closer and closer to Sunset Boulevard and today sadly we've heard a lot of tales of heartbreak people who have lost their homes who are evacuating and say they also saw Neighbors homes on fire but there's also stories of hero ISM including one man that we spoke to a short while ago his name is Patrick hilderbran and I want to share with you with what he told us no you know it's at your risk oh so you were you actually you got some people out I went up I took one guy up to check his mom on Enchanted Way which is four houses from the house we lost and then CA El media him and I were up there and we watched two houses go up and it's the palm trees really like they just explode and it spreads everywhere and you said you just you lost your house I'm so sorry insured cat is safe got the medications and the paperwork you know everybody's healthy that's all that matters so well you're amazing cuz I mean you just suffer L but you're still out there helping people what else I going sit around I tears you know so that's not going to help anything so yeah I want to help people nice to see the community you know looking out for each other yes and these bikes people people don't like these bikes but right now these bikes are saving people and he went back in again he is still trying to help people at this hour and a short while ago there were a lot more people here it seems that those who had opted to ignore the evacuation order are now heating it and that's also evidenced by what we're seeing here if you had come out to us about an hour ago this would have been backed up you would have seen cars bumper to bumper on Sunset Boulevard but uh traffic control came in and most people had already evacuated so traffic slowed down and now as you can see non-existent but we're still seeing people who are coming in frantic to get to loved ones uh about a half hour ago we spoke to a woman who father has Alzheimer's and he gets very agitated so he can't just go with anyone she was desperate desperate to get to him and get him out she told us he'd been living in that house for 70 years trouble is she didn't have the proper ID because to get in you need an identification that shows the address in the evacuation order area she didn't have that because she does not live with her father but fortunately the officers here worked with her and she was in tears as she was let through that's the latest from here let's send it back to you oh my good what an emotional exchange that would have been I'm so glad that they let her through to get to her father all right christe thank you so much uh we want to show you this is the smaller picture here that is the command post at Will Rogers State Beach you see all those fire officials sort of Milling about they're obviously there together to unify and to inform we are waiting for a press conference to start you see the woman taking the podium obviously there'll be some mic checks and we know that Governor Gavin Nome he is there uh maybe he is there amongst the crowd right now I don't see him but he is said to be there and will be speaking looks like Sheriff's Department is there this is an all handson deck uh effort this firefight of course as we're zooming in we see Zach Sidell with LA mayor Karen bass's office and Captain Eric Scott there from the LA fire department who's such a a great spokesperson for them um who's guided us through this uh we probably hear from him we see some of the reporters trying doing some mic checks to make sure that everybody's ready um this press conference is expected to begin uh at any moment now we see the Los Angeles Police Department is there um this is a fire that's so big you expect to see a lot of other agencies from other parts of the state and potentially even from around the country uh come in to help um but right now we do see the the folks from Southern California taking the lead on this fire um and we expect to potentially hear new information in terms of the acreage and uh new information in terms of the plan to fight this fire tonight because Marlo the bad news is uh the winds are supposed to get worse right yes so we've heard from Adam Krueger our chief meteorologist who's tracking those wind uh sustained wind speeds and Gus that later on around midnight uh they're forecasted to be as high as 60 MPH even into the 70s for your Wednesday morning that doesn't mean that it actually will be that but it it's it's definitely going to pick up there will be a moment uh to uh for a little bit of a reprieve later on thank goodness but that's not going to last long and I know that you're pointing to ell County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath is there and Governor Gavin Nome yeah Tracy Park go ahead yeah uh sorry the governor just uh arrived here along with some of the other officials Governor Nome uh was in Southern California supposed to be with President Biden today in thermal which is uh in the Coachella Valley to designate a National Monument um the president did not end up going there because it was deemed not safe to travel there um and so he made that announcement virtually and then Governor Nome instead of staying in thermal came here to Southern California um to meet with the folks responsible for this he just got a tour um in that area of some of the Flames there um and so he is a part of this emergency response we see Lindsay Horvath there as you mentioned um from the LA County Board of Supervisors as well uh it looks like marqueis Harris Dawson who is the city council president is there so basically uh almost all of the elected officials Sans Karen bass who apparently is out of the country the mayor of Los Angeles are there together to try to show a unified front um in talking about what happens there John Lee member of the city council Tracy Park member of the city council uh Chief Crowley right all uh there and so um my guest is a lot of them are going to talk and it's probably going to take a while but uh yeah and we're approaching the podium uh maybe this is just for a mic check or to get remarks set up but it looks like this press conference will be underway sooner than later while we wait for that we had Matthew seedorf in a really precarious situation earlier where homes were burning let's show you that on Via Cresta we've been seeing these Flames grow even more especially with that wind right now you can see this massive Bloom of smoke and Flame windows are breaking and really this home seems like it's being considered a loss because of the massive fire and Sam if you want to follow us to the home next to it it looks like it was under construction uh but it is now gone we've been trying to speak with residents out here and for the most part it seems like people have evacuated but we did speak with someone that drove by just wondering where are the firefighters um we did see a couple of firefighters nearby and we've actually been even trying to help them put out some of these hot spots and on homes using garden hoses there's another house if we could follow this direction um that's also Up in Flames right now this feel the heat coming off of that and the Embers that are going up in the air with these winds that are gusted uh in some spots over 30 m per hour firefighters just got to this home on the other side of Vesta that's also Up in Flames right now and uh we have three firefighters here and it looks like they're getting this fire knocked down pretty good but about half the fire half the home looks like it was heavily damaged by these ples looks like they're trying to get inside the garage right now trying to get inside the garage right now just so they can get another angle on this fire and hopefully there's no one inside yeah looks like they're just trying to attack from the inside scary situation out here goad back wow amazing amazing video there from Matthew seedorf and his photographer Sam duven a short time ago uh in Pacific Palisades our thanks to them um they were able to get out of there safely we will go back to them when we can um as we continue to look at some of these pictures of all these cars that were bulldozed um by officials because they were deemed to be in the way um and many of them now been total um off on the side of the road these were abandoned cars and we're waiting this press conference we can see our Haley Winslow is right there um in the picture getting ready we expect this thing to get underway within the next minute or so um and hopefully get some guidance in terms of uh where we go from here and maybe some updated numbers in terms of the strategy we heard from Joel Pollock um uh the who is A from breit Bart but also a resident there who was concerned and frustrated by some of the response that led to images like this uh it'll be interesting to hear if if um if they address any of those potential concerns although right now we're sort of in the um life-threatening fight ORF flight mode for this and maybe there'll be time for some of the after action analysis they really want to get through the the brunt of this and we are in a emergency crisis situation happening right now as we continue to look at live pictures of all of these abandoned cars that uh are no longer going to be working it is a sight to see uh in terms of acreage calfire is now estimating it to be at 1,262 Acres a wide swath of the Palisades under a mandatory evacuation those numbers could be updated uh when we get the latest from lafd and the governor that will happen as you heard ellex say momentarily evacuation centers are set up one is at Westwood Recreation Center this is on seula Boulevard between wilsh and Ohio uh they do accept small animals and then also the Dream Center that's a little further out oh wow uh but or farther out pardon me uh the Dream Center in Hollywood that has opened its doors 247 to anybody who needs some help uh they have opened their doors as an evacuation Center as well they do such great work and they have decided to open their doors for this uh very scary emergency that is underway in the Palisades the Dream Center um usually performs the function of helping the homeless through uh faith-based Rehabilitation programs and work programs and a very successful um year-long program to help people get clean and sober um but uh in times of Crisis as we've seen over and over again they have stepped up to serve the Greater Community and it sounds like they are doing that once again um are those sprinklers in Iran uh yeah uh so as we look at this this street with these abandoned cars as we continue to get a sense and it looks like um some officials here may be approaching the microphone and are we about to begin here looks like we are about to begin uh this this press conference as we see um the assembled leadership from Southern California and the state and uh we had a feeling that that seal was not going to stand but we know who's here we now see Jim McDonald the chief of LAPD is there as well um and so Chief as well uh Chief Crowley and uh the tall one that is the public information officer who you see often on your television Eric Scott he provides great information on behalf of lafd there's County there's City uh there's State officials so it runs the whole gamut uh I'm I'm sure this is going to last for some time as they update us and then hopefully there'll be another update later tonight but first and foremost this would be the first press conference since fire broke out at 10:30 let go my name is uh Captain Eric Scott the lead public information officer for the Palisades fire on behalf of everyone behind me thank you for being here thank you for educating the public uh through your message so this is all for

first of all I just want to thank all the firefighters who are on the and First Responders that are fighting this fire right now also a big thank you to all the organizations throughout the city county and state that are assisting our firefighters in what they need to do today as chair of the Public Safety Committee it's my job to uh monitor situations all throughout the city of Los Angeles and the most important information that I can share with you today is to all of our residents as soon as we get any new information we are trying to disseminate that as quickly as possible it's important that you listen to that information as someone who represents a district that is commonly affected by fires tell you one of the issues that is we ask our residents to do is if you're asked to evacuate if you're asked to St off whatever it is that we're asking you if you're in one of those affected areas that you don't create additional problems for our firefighters so our firefighters can focus on what they're supposed to do and that's getting this fire out thank you all for being here thank you council member and now we'd like to ask the governor Gavin new to please speak thank everybody a hell of a way to start a new year uh again let me have my voice the voice of so many others and extending uh deep appreciation of men and women in uniform across jurisdictions I want to thank in particular Chief Carley and chief morone for your outstanding leadership uh police chief Sheriff's Office uh all of our local law enforcement agencies that work hand and glove there is simply no better Mutual Aid System anywhere in the United States of America and you're seeing it now it's scale once again uh here in Southern California I say once again because we were here not too long ago the Franklin fire uh a few weeks prior to that the Mountain Fire November December now January there's no fire season it's fire year it's year round and it's incredibly important that we heed the warnings the calls um that we're not out of the woods by any stretch of imagination you may feel at home uh that you're fine down in Riverside County San Bernardino County uh down in Ventura County uh other parts of the state but there's a reason we prepositioned hundreds of assets and Personnel on Sunday in anticipation of this wind event 110 engines specifically were sent down 45 by calire a 65 through our mutual Aid system through the office of emergency services water tenders down here seven new helicopters we brought from Northern California down to Southern California we just brought our C130 down from Northern California and already just had its first drop by no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods you heard a chief say 10 p.m. tonight to 5:00 a.m. tomorrow will be Peak winds and having just quite literally an hour or so ago gone up the canyon and saw firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the Embers and the number of structures that are destroyed not a few many structures already destroyed and the fact that people were still not evacuated still did not heed the warning we're just coming down the canyon uh is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders we've all been to memorials I've never been to a memorial for a building but for family members and loved ones I I know you cannot say this enough it's foundational one other thing I want to say because you can't say it enough is expression of gratitude the president United States happens to be in town it didn't take more than a text message to get the fmag approved which means we're getting reimbursed with the vast majority of these uh costs uh no politics no hand ringing kissing on the feet president United States said yes what else do you need emergency proclamations being drafted as we speak uh and I just want to thank the president because that's something I don't take for granted and something we should not take for granted at this moment in American history so thank you President Biden as well uh final Point uh we encourage you you heard all those websites I don't want to burden you with any more except one a fire.ca.gov and why do I say that nothing like it in the countries nothing like that we've seen in any jurisdiction around the world 3D maps and live camps on fire.ca.gov it also will show you the evacuation orders I encourage people uh to take a look uh at that site for information and of course ready.com uh to make sure that you're prepared uh as we work through uh yet another extraordinary month uh in this fire year uh petual fire year here in the state of California thank you again to all of the folks behind me and the outstanding leadership of all the elected officials as well and forgive me one point I'd be remiss thank you to Mayor bass who was on the phone immediately this morning uh making sure even in obena that she's here uh organizing everything she can to make sure we're successful as well thank you Governor appreciate that we'd like to open this up now for Spanish and then we'll go to questions so we'd like to have public information officer for lfd David Ortiz so as uh they do the Spanish translation uh just want to recap some of the news uh that just came from there Governor Newsome saying that he's been in contact with President Biden who happens to be in Southern California today uh and that emergency funding from the federal government is coming he said didn't want to bring politics into it although he did get a little bit of a dig at Donald Trump who has potentially threatened withholding emergency funding in the future if Newsome doesn't do what he wants uh that's why he was suggesting that Joe Biden uh did not give any questions asked there um and uh the the basics here the good news Mara is that so far no injuries but interesting how Governor Nome mentioned the fact that he saw multiple structures burn we don't have any actual number yet um but he made it seem like it wasn't just a few that are burning and we are getting some indication from our uh reporter Christy Fardo on the ground uh that Palace st's High School may be burning we're trying to get more details on that and hopefully get to her soon um but uh that is a dangerous situation 30,000 residents under evacuation 25,000 plus households currently remain threatened best news is no injuries to speak of again it's early in the investigation and in this fire fight so that could very well change you mentioned that Pacific Palisades uh Palisades High School is currently on fire uh the Getty Villa was also threatened earlier but I'm seeing images and being told that the fire of those Flames did make its way around the Getty Villa so that at this point has been preserved uh on the ground we also have uh Chelsea Edwards joining our coverage now uh if Chelsea is available there you are you're in the highlands area they talked about this area being uh vulnerable and obviously under evacuation zone now we do have some good news report in that b so this was the area where a lot of people were told to go back and then shelter in place this area is under an evacuation order but earlier today the fire they say jumped Palisades Drive and this is the only way in and out firefighters just thought it was too dangerous to be getting people down this Canyon so they pushed everyone who was on the north side of it up and everyone on the south side of it down and told everyone on the North side to to shelter in place uh but you can see these cars coming down now so this is good news they've just allowed these residents out of their homes I understand we another press conference that we're going to is that right yeah so Chelsea thank you we're going to go back to the press conference they're now answering questions let's listen to Chief Christen did push out information for people to evacuate now the lean forward posture and I want to talk about that first and foremost was communicating the Potential Threat of what was coming that information was out it was out early in regard to everybody be ready be ready set and go when that go order came out at that point that is that very important point where the public can and should heed that warning and start to evacuate now we know there's limited access erress in certain areas within the hills right behind me so with that that's what we believe did happen people did evacuate it was slow to evacuate what I have been briefed on is that the evacuations were slow but they did occur and we will follow up on that if there's anything better in the future that we can communicate to the constituents and continue to train to that because the evacuation order we can never do it early enough so with that we want to continue to work with the community ensure that when that evacuation order happens that they can evacuate in a timely manner but we understand what you're saying and just one of for the governor sure you you mentioned the Cent Administration not get into Poli of it but what's your message Administration about what you just saw here today given that that's going to be part of we know that there City collaboration state and federal collaboration well we're alling this together um none of us are asking for respective political identities around here everybody's rolling in the same direction because everyone gives a damn they're here for each other and that's the spirit that defines the best of this state and this country um and uh no one here is playing politics um we have a American president and and Joe Biden uh that recognizes his responsibility in times of emergency when Americans are in need he steps up he steps in not qualified by a particular request or an expectation uh and so again I I say what I said because I I at the moment I don't take that for granted candidly like I have been the last few years uh it's rather precious and I my message to the incoming Administration and I'm not here to play any politics is please don't play any politics uh there's not there's a time and place for that uh and at this moment where your question only reinforces the moments the precious moments that we have to evacuate uh we don't have time for any of that Mig Goos whoever is with the worst wind Yet to Come what the plan in place obviously I know you're probably trying to get as many you know boots on the ground as possible but also in the air um coming from people who are they literally just left as you're saying um they were wondering as well why um I know you are probably doing everything you can to get as many aircraft but to drop more water that's their concern so your questions in reference to the increase severity of wind and resources and aircraft okay yeah was your question regarding nighttime aircraft operations yeah just obviously the worst is yet to come at about 10 p.m. and overnight right so the plan is they're developing a plan for nighttime air operations it's going to be a combination of LA City fire units LA County Fire units State Fire units and that quick reaction force of the CH 47s that drop retardant at night we are going to take advantage of of the uh lower temperatures at night but with increased wind speed aerial firefighting becomes more dangerous there is a cut off m per hour wind at which we will not operate at night flying during the night is more dangerous than flying during the day we want to make sure that we don't get anybody killed uh but we do want to fly both day and night so we're going to have to wait and see what happens I mean it's it's going to be interesting if the winds are going to get worse right now it's going to be very difficult for our our aerial assets to actually make a difference uh for the folks on the ground what's the cut off with it it could be 30 to 40 m an hour sustained um you know we do have history of operating with high gusts uh but it really isn't effective because as the water exits the bottom of the drop tank it just gets Carried Away by the wind and never reaches the ground so there really is no point to putting people at risk I if that firefight isn't making a difference thank [Music] you was your answered question yeah I mean this is only one fire we've got you know two more days of this too I mean I don't know how many resources how more people you're be able to that's the beauty of automatic and mutual Aid so there's automatic Aid agreements between all of these agencies here they brought their additional boots on the ground and as a governor mentioned we have uh State Mutual Aid so cowf fires come in we'll get the appropriate quantity and type of resources to mitigate this emergency and it's an opportunity of neighbor helping neighbor and we will do the same thing in Northern California when they need it yes [Music] sure so questions about Abandoned cars that that's a good question that has come up uh law enforcement assists us heavily with evacuation but please remember it's an active incident we don't have the answers to all of these questions we will certainly look at that that's very important I don't know if police felt like they wanted to uh make a mention to evacuations okay yeah just on on that question of evacuations Vehicles left in the roadway uh if you have to leave a vehicle in the roadway get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles can't get by the gist of moving them with uh bulldozers was an emergency situation you got to get those fire resources through and they do what they have to do to be able to facilitate that so we're asking really for the cooperation and think a couple of steps ahead it's it's not just your vehicle there but then others line up behind you as well as they see what you're doing and so uh I can't stress enough please follow the evacuation orders do your best to be able to get out to safety uh bring the equipment you you will need for the next couple of days with you because as you've heard over and over again this is not going to end very quickly thank you I could just expand a little bit on Saturday uh State started to convene uh respective leadership across the state of California at the office of emergency services uh we started to preposition uh early evening on Sunday uh in six or seven counties here in Southern California quite literally moved assets from Northern California into Southern California just as an example moments ago we had a chance to meet crew from Santa Cruz and from Santa Clara County that just were deployed uh up the mountain those resources remain prepositioned currently in other counties in anticipation of the concern you just expressed in the wind events we are anticipating hopefully we're wrong but we're anticipating other fires happening concurrently and that's exactly the previous experience we've had with these kinds of win events and that's why we continue uh to provide and supplement those resources from all across Northern California in particular one final thing because I think it's important my phone lights up all the time including this morning about people saying well where are all the planes you said you put all these assets I want to him uh it was important what the what the Chiefs just said we could be up there all day making people feel good but we're not doing any good because that retardant flies all over the place and so it's not that the the planes themselves can't handle the turbulence and the wind shears it's that simply you're not suppressing anything and so it is a point I know of frustration but then it also reinforces the preciousness of the hand crws and the men and women that are on the ground holding the line that are up there as we speak and that's also part of the specialty units that are part of these larger operations we have an instant command team that quite literally is organized here in real time and we're gaming out the next few days with the benefit of something we have in the past new technology uh technos and other AI enabled technology that allows us predictive capacity in a way we've never had in the past which is also aiding our efforts to not just prevent in some cases as relat to early detection uh but also prepare uh to suppress in subsequent incidences uh yes sir uh with winds expected to pick up to we have any projections for where the fire might move next or any areas that might be it's been moving in a Southwest Direction uh towards Getty which is moving towards the Los Angeles County Fire Department's jurisdiction it did begin in the city and that's the unified command good and uh real quick uh I know you said that there's no reported injuries are there any unaccounted individuals show you have count on that uh not that we're aware of at this point so that's that is part of the process they are having uh you know evacuation groups that are looking at that but we're not aware of any individuals unaccounted for some we did receive multiple 911 calls for a particular address we did send resources in to rescue people what are you telling folks in the west area Santa Monica and further South should they stay put should they keep their phones on overnight I mean what should people do who are kind of on the edge here between the fire out okay so what are that we telling the People South of the fire yeah you want me to take that or anybody else uh thank you for asking that question your question was what are we communicating to individuals that are south of the incident I think it's really really important for the entire public to understand as you can see how dynamic these winds are and how quickly they can change on a dime so you may think okay I'm okay I'm safe but the key is the communication listen for those evacuation orders and warnings and also be Super Hyper diligent in regard to what could happen if an individual within the community wants to lean forward and just say I don't want to I'm not going to risk anything I'm just going to go and go to a different area where it may be safer just know from the south and with the winds as unpredictable as they are are there's very very much at risk so we want people to be very cognizant of that make good decisions make sure they can understand realtime information and we will communicate that and articulate that very clearly but this is very very very Dynamic and you can just by standing here seeing us with the wind gusts and with the predictability of this wind's going to get worse tonight so we want people to lean forward Ready set go and be ready thank you uh thank you we're going to go ahead and conclude the press conference at this point um we'll let you know if we have another press conference tonight that's not necessarily likely there will be pios available here for additional questions tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. we do anticipate to have another joint press conference thank you all for sharing this important information all right we've just wrapped the latest from uh County and city and state officials again the count is just over 12200 Acres close to 1300 Acres multiple structures burn but they don't have a count as to how many exactly best news is at this point no injuries uh to speak of let's go on the ground though to Christy Fardo she is out there and it is gusting where you are where are you Christie I'm actually on Sunset at Via de laaz and uh we just witnessed how quickly things can change because when that press conference started we were actually at Sunset and tascal Canyon and suddenly it got very dark it looked almost like night time that's the winds were gusting and there was Ash and smoke just being kicked up and suddenly that fire just exploded for unfortunately we know that there have been a couple of more structures that have been added to the damaged at least toll since that press conference started because we saw houses on the hill and suddenly some of that was on fire and there was one man who raced down he was in a convertible and he told us that uh his house was one of them he said it was on fire as he was leaving and I want to show you what it looks like now you can see how Smoky it is visibility is very very poor here and we're not that far from tascal and sunset unfortunately as we were leaving we could see that P high that there was things that were burning there I do not know if they were structures but something on the property was definitely on fire hopefully it was shrubs we were facing the the field so been something in the field that was on fire and sadly there were also palm trees on the south side of tascal near Sunset there were also on fire and apartment buildings there were threatened and people the ones who had not evacuated were streaming out and now as you can see you can even hear them fire alarms are going off all around us the LAPD just came through here and ordered the gas station that is on the corner here the 76 to close and we're seeing little spot fires in fact if we pan this way you might be able to see that there was one started in the parking lot of this gon because every now and then we get these big gusts and it starts raining Embers and unfortunately we've also been seeing the power lines arcing on Via de la pa so very dangerous situation and those who had not opted to leave are now leaving and can we pan over there and show those shopping carts that's how Gusty it is they're just moving around in this parking structure and that is essentially what firefighters are dealing with at this hour and you can see the gust just hit whatever was burning over there and now we're starting to see flames and that is how quickly the situation can change let's send it back to you yeah we talk about the fact that Embers in these situations can potentially go 2 miles and so you think of all of those spots that we're seeing in that image right there there's a little fire there a little fire there in all these different Direction so not only could the fire start there but those could then become Embers that move in other directions that could start another fire so what's so challenging for the firefighters as you see from these images is that you can't be everywhere marlot there's just too many fires and it becomes a question of where do you go what's the priority and in some places that means you have to let homes burn which is a horrible situation for any of the homeowners uh who are impacted by that but that's the tough um calculation that these fire crews are having to do let's go to Chelsea Edwards she's at sunset in Palisades and you are it looks like where all of those cars were bulldozed earlier yeah I mean the only word that comes to mind honestly Mara and ellex is apocalyptic I mean you just look at this and can imagine the Panic these people must have felt when this was going on so they're trying to get out this is in both directions as you can see and then a bulldozer which is just up to the to the left up there up on Palisades Drive just had to come through and literally bulldoze these cars out of the way so that people and so that uh emergency responders especially could get through to either side and that's because the fire is really on all sides of where we're standing right now here in the highlands so again we're on Sunset Boulevard right near Palisades Drive uh this is where a lot of people up in the highlands were told to evacuate um and but then the fire jumped palisad Drive which is really the only way in and out of that particular neighborhood and that's when authorities made the difficult decision to say you know what if you're north of this you got to go back and shelter in place we'll try to come when we can thankfully they have been able to do that those residents who are up there have now been able to come down the hill which is very good news but look at some of this aftermath Elliot if we can turn to our left here look at this Canyon so when we first got here this was on fire I mean you could barely see visibility was very very low a lot of debris in the air still is in the air and you can see see how the wind is just pushing the smoke so echoing what Christy was saying the wind is just so unpredictable I mean there's times where it's it's kind of laying down and it seems almost like it's not moving and then out of nowhere my colleague Elliot mza and I are almost you know we're about to get knocked over because it's just so powerful in One Direction and then 2 minutes later it's blowing in the other direction so right now obviously going pretty strongly this way but look at this charred Hillside there's just no vegetation left on this and unfortunately from our camera and from our angle from the last uh little probably an hour now we have seen a lot of plumes of black smoke very large plumes of black smoke a big one is up there which is sort of in the highlands neighborhood it's hard to tell exactly where that is but it appears that there oh sorry Elliot sorry just stepped on some debris from a car here this is actually a a side mirror it looks like that was bulldozed off but when we look up there and we see those black plumes unfortunately you know that's an indication that homes are burning up there especially when they're that size the plumes that we've been seeing you can see the smoke is thickening as well and we've been seeing a lot of this where the conditions just rapidly change for a minute there we were up this way on Sunset Boulevard to the east our live truck was kind of parked and facing uphill but all of a sudden Flames started coming from this Lake Shrine area which is just just south of this hedge where we're standing here and they got so close to the truck we had to just jump in and get out of there there were actually some people who were not firefighters I'm not sure who these people were but they were picking up the firefighters hoses and trying to save some of these cars uh because the F the Flames were just coming right up against these cars and right up against our live van I actively saw them save at least one car up that way a little bit uh from from just going up into flames and of course the danger is that any of these cars go up into flames these are all scrunched together no one has keys there's no one here to operate these cars if one goes up there's a high likelihood that they could all go up together but just look at this scene I mean look at the force that would have hit this you got the side mirror knocked off you got this whole front bumper this whole front area dented uh over here same thing I mean they just had to plow their way through in order to get these emergency responders to different areas now again the fire is on all sides of us so if we look up this Hillside you can see some charring up there those were active Flames when we first got here we saw a lot of large Embers that were just flying around I mean it's again just one of those things where you just it's unpredictable you don't know where they're going to land where they could spark where they're going to end up so you know you're dealing with that and then you look again to the distance La if you can go up a little bit and see those Flames up I don't know if that's a home or if those are are uh you know what those are up there but something's burning up there and you just think I I mean it's just it's just unpredictable out here it's just a wild scene but the good news is all those people that were up in the highlands area who were told to turn around which must have been just terrifying for those people up there to have to turn around and go back to your homes when there are active Flames encroaching in all of those res at least according to the people that I've spoken to on the ground have now been allowed out of their homes they got police escorts and uh fire Personnel escorts down the hill they were very eagerly taking a right I tried to talk to a couple of them as they were coming down and the looks on their faces were very Talent they wanted nothing to do with anything that did not involve getting out of there U it's been a harrowing day for everybody living up there and it looks at least from where we're standing and we haven't confirmed this but it looks like homes were lost somewhere in that vicinity again these huge black plumes of smoke that have been coming up just time and time again we're hearing explosion after explosion uh don't know if those are Transformers or what but there's also action down here uh we've got some Palm FRS that were uh that had started to go up we saw some police officers grabbing fire hoses and dowsing kind of upwards trying to get those palm trees so that they wouldn't go up and then cause Embers to fly which would of course endanger everybody in this area as well so I mean just looking at this as you walk around I this it feels like we're either on a on a movie set or I mean we're not this is this is real life and this is this is the reality of how dangerous these fires are and how quickly these emergency responders have to make decisions uh when it when it is just such an emergency like this I mean there was obviously when you look at the aftermath there was just no time I mean they just had to make that call and say all right we got to move these cars and they did it and this is the aftermath so you know and you know also have to think about the people who are in these cars imagine the terror to make that decision I know we've been talking about that on our a all day but you know what point in your mind do you think okay we've got to go you know let's leave everything in the car let's leave our valuables let's leave the car which is valuable of course these a lot of these are very nice cars and just run um oh Elliot look over here we've got some active Flames so this has been flaring up quite a bit not sure exactly where this is this is looking West on Sunset but you see those big Flames over there there's a lot of vegetation back there and we've seen a lot of these flare ups but we've also seen right in that pocket so somewhere west of Palisades Drive also again those big plumes of black smoke which indicates that something else is burning up there so obviously some vegetation not sure if that's a home or not but I mean really everywhere you look you can see pockets of active flame and you can certainly feel it in the air see it in the air it is the visibility is very low and the smoke is just so incredibly thick so I mean just it's just a wild scene out here but again that good news it does appear that they were able to get everyone who was Sheltering in place up in the Islands were able to get them out to safety so obviously this is an active and developing situation we'll be here on the ground bringing you the latest as we get it just wild Chelsea what's it like driving around right now oh driving well when we were coming in it is just absolute gridlock I mean you you can't move in any direction and I was just looking at the people's oh here's here's a g we're going to go see if we can talk to this person carrying what appears to be all of her belongings oh my goodness she's got a a suitcase and a bag excuse me ma'am are you all right are you okay I'm good yes what I mean what made you what do you have here 9-year-old's dog is he what's going on with is there fluffs Sal lot I my son got evacuated St Matthews oh he's got to be so scared so I went to drop my son up at school at um me at u a friend's house after school and then deserted my car somewhere up here so one of these cars is your car no I'm like on B Vanita and sunset I ran down here and I probably made it about a mile and a half on foot up the mountain little bit of an apocalypse situation but then a fire truck saw me and gave me a right rest it away so then I got my dog and grabbed some stuff and made my way down so so you physically ran back to your home to rescue your dog yeah I had to give my son's dog we already lost a dog last year when now our house got broken into him br oh and I wasn't going to put him through that again so I got my ski goggles which by the way came in very handy cuz my eyes were burning on the way up the mountain but uh thanks to some Good Samaritans giving me a ride halfway up and back down I'm going to go see if my car is still where I left it and go find my son oh my God good luck to you and I just what is your home still standing as far as you're aware uh townhouse is still standing I do own a little children's store called the gry dragon of Marquez and I know there was lots of fires right there uh behind like Marquez Elementary and stuff so I don't know so we'll we'll see are you going to try to drive out once you get to your car um if I can get to my car if I can get out great if not then I'll figure it out so please stay safe and good luck to you what's your name Adele Adele ad what yes Hayden rich thank you so much Adele good luck I a little worried about Adele walking up here on her own um she she seems because this is really emergency responders only but goodness her attitude is incredible yeah she's very just I'm going to do this it's what I have to do I had to rescue sir fluffs a lot for my son uh you know I mean she is just a trooper she is determined uh so we'll I hope her car is still there that was that was incredible I hope it is too um we we'll try to catch up with her in just a bit all right Chelsea we'll let you get back to that reporting thank you for for that and thank you to photographer Elliot Mendoza for some great work out there uh as we approach the 4:30 half hour Alex Michaelson Mara is here with special coverage we are preempting TMZ live today uh for this Palisades fire which has burned more than 12200 Acres on the west side of Los Angeles and continues to burn out of control uh Fox 11's Matthew seedorf has seen some of the worst destruction he joins us live right now Matthew talk to us about where you are and what you're seeing yeah Alex really this is just horrible to see we're off lockman Lane up in Pacific palisad this is just one of I 12 homes we've seen today uh get destroyed by these massive and and uh you can see firefighters are here trying to do their best to really put it out um this home is at this point you'd imagine is a total loss but trying to keep the hot spots from clearing up and popping up more downhill massive amount of smoke we're seeing fires like this kind of scattered all over what is relatively a a very residential area I do want to show you uh if you can swing it this way the firefighters actually pulled a grandfather clock out of this house managed to save that but if you look at the house itself I mean it is uh there is a total all right we'll have you to it down here signal problems with Matthew Matthew seedorf and his crew there do we have him back let's let's go right we're out go go ahead Matthew let's try it one more time maybe maybe not as much movement if if possible yeah the uh the cell reception in the area is not great as we are also um dealing with that and as well as these strong winds the winds really pushing the flames and making it uh worse and spread very quickly but firefighters doing their best to just extinguish the Flames at this house keep it from shooting more Embers up in the air and starting other homes nearby and real quick Matthew because it sort of cut out when you were saying this did you say that you have seen yourself 12 homes burn that's correct I'd say at least at least 12 and kind of in different areas of Pacific Palisades um kind of spotty but yeah definitely um at least yeah you even picked up the hose earlier to try and put out some Flames uh when there were no fire crews around okay stay safe we'll check in with you uh in just a bit Matthew cedor for rep in for us let's go to Christy vardo she has another vantage point of Pacific Palisades Christie yeah we're actually on Sunset at Via de laaz and I told you in the last live shot that we were hearing fire alarms going off and we now know that some of that smoke that you see right over there is coming from an apartment building that is on fire on tascal Canyon Road and we actually saw the Flames jump domasco Canyon Road and we also saw fire on pal High property and Aaron Lynch we actually met her earlier a couple hours ago when things looked much different but you drove through there what did you see at Ply High yeah there's uh fire in the stadium the stands are burning there's vegetation on the high school property even the road had some fire going across it the pavement you know the black top and yeah and then that huge building across the way was completely engulfed and when we met you earlier you had left your neighborhood things were looking a lot better then the wind came in and we we witnessed that firstand suddenly Sky got really dark started seeing Embers flying everywhere and that's what you were driving out of you had gone to your house to get your motorcycle what did you see in your neighborhood uh right on my street a couple houses were starting to burn there was the vegetation right by the houses and uh right up the block on both ends there are houses that are completely gone number of houses that I saw burning and then other houses up there that I know must be but yeah it's it's pretty ugly it's pretty ugly I'm so sorry that you and your neighbors are going through that but you were saying you've actually experienced this before yes I believe the last time that we had a big fire on these Hills here was 1979 when I saw the Flames coming over in the afternoon and it was the beginning and that was the last time we were evacuated 1979 yeah um I know you're finally leaving you're not you're not going to go back and I I am so glad you're safe you're going to Brentwood you were and uh go hang out with a friend yeah yep you know yeah what you know than thank you so much I know this has been a very very harrowing day you know for you I'm sad for a lot of my neighbors there's a lot of people that are not going to have a very good January 2025 now and and you lived there a long time I imagine it's a close-nit community yeah people know people nearby and they're you know down the street and around the corner and yeah so it's going to be tough and as far as you could tell everybody had evacuated yes there are a few people in their cars and hanging around but mostly nobody's hanging around in their house few people hosing things off and stuff and what street do you live on Ela Ela yeah well thank you so much stay safe you're I appreciate it thanks so you can see the the winds and this is what firefighters are dealing with because we've been talking about those Embers and we saw that we witnessed that firstand that was just took one big gust and a lot of neighbors were really concerned about an elderly man who lived up above on the hill because they told us they tried to get him to evacuate and he was out there we could see him on the hillside with his hose and he was watering down his property but suddenly we couldn't see him or even his house anymore because there was so much smoke and Flame so hopefully hopefully he got out or hopefully hopefully his home is safe but a lot of harrowing stories we're hearing out here let's send it back to you Christy vardo thank you for that we're rooting for her uh in the meantime we want to bring in our meteorologist Adam Krueger you were warning about this uh last night really for several days and uh the worst is still to come right Adam we have to move guys yeah I would say so the strongest wins are expected tonight through tomorrow morning and obviously it's already been very windy also the driest air is yet to come it's going to get a little drier tomorrow than what we see right now so this part of the forecast I'm going to share with you will be the forecast wind gust and then we'll look at forecast relative hum and by the way when we show you these numbers when we're talking about gust there's a difference there between sustained winds and gust gust would be how strong the winds could be at any specific moment just a burst of wind that might get this strong whereas the sustained wind would be the average over a couple minutes so sustained winds are going to be a little bit less intense than the numbers you see right here but let's walk you through what we expect this evening and I've got Pacific Palisades highlighted right there as expected again as we go later into tonight we are going to start to find the winds picking up so here's a look at what our model is showing at about 7:00 and this is a new model if you were watching about an hour or so ago this is a fresh model run so the latest available data now watch these numbers here as we go into 9:00 tonight this model is suggesting there may be winds now ramping up with gusts that could exceed 60 MPH and it's not just the Pacific Palisades I mean you see the map here there are high numbers scattered all around Southern California so we continue to monitor all areas like we heard during the press conference the resources are in place because it's possible that something might spark somewhere else and even in the Pacific Palisades area we see this just almost impossible to keep up with flare ups that are happening all over the place uh you know just an ember flies and starts a fire there Ember flies somewhere else and these can travel quite far a mile or two ahead of the fire sometimes all right so this is 9:00 tonight now as we go through the night here's 2:00 in the morning look at these numbers again we still see gusts in many spots that could be over 60 MPH so this is that example that late tonight through tomorrow morning is going to be the most intense winds here we are 4:00 in the morning 60 to 70 mph gusts are still on the map here we going to 9:00 tomorrow morning and you know it's just it's it gives you chills kind of to see these numbers continuing at that same level we get into midday tomorrow and tomorrow afternoon then we're over the hump it's not like we're totally in the clear but we're over the hump as far as the strongest winds go there's still going to be some areas where it's going to be windy the air will still be very dry and there's still a wildfire danger with red flag warnings continuing into Thursday in some areas but the high wind warnings that ends at 600 p.m. tomorrow all right now as far as the humidity we've seen relative humidity below 20% in in several areas today that's what we're seeing right now we know when the fire started in the Pacific Palisades earlier this morning in the press conference they mentioned the relative humidity was around I think 15% or so is what they mentioned now let's run this into tomorrow here's the forecast relative humidity I'll pause it midday tomorrow and notice how the numbers are overall even lower some spots could be below 10% extremely dry air very strong winds it's a very difficult combination and as far as those wins I'll I'll highlight this if you missed it in the press conference earlier but the official are saying that you know people are wondering where's the air support why aren't we seeing a lot during the night time it's actually uh the winds if they're strong enough it's not that it's unsafe for the aircraft to fly around but whatever they're going to do to take care of the fire whatever they're dropping if you know winds are gusting over 40 or so it's almost like what's the use it just gets scattered away from the wind and that doesn't really land on its Target so that's another you know element that makes this all just a little bit more uh complicated here as we we just need to wait for the weather really to settle down we're start seeing that late day Wednesday Thursday still red flag conditions though and even Friday is not ideal but we'll be past the worst of this by the end of the day tomorrow and into tomorrow night guys all right Adam thanks so much let's give you the latest information as we look at the plume of smoke from this camera here uh let's throw up all that information if we could uh so at this point 1,262 Acres have burned multiple structures uh have also burned we don't have an exact count there we go uh 0% contained of course mandatory evacuation orders uh are in place 30,000 residents have evacuated more than 25,000 people remain or rather households remain threatened uh and and the 10K homes that's 10,000 people within those 25,000 plus households uh it's a lot of numbers but bottom line this is this is if you're in the Pacific Palisades you are under some sort of evacuation order given the threat of those Wom and the destructive ability of the Winds let's go on the ground now to Chelsea Edwards she has been giving us a look at all of those cars that have been bulldozed it looks like you've now moved locations a little bit so we've walked we've taken a right onto Palisades Drive this is where all those homes where where the fire actually jumped the road and this is where firefighters had to make that call to just separate the people who were to the South and to the north of that fire path and to stay you say go back and shelter in place or to continue on to Sunset Boulevard so you can see wind has just kicked up again I mean look at these Palm frons up at the top so firefighters just doing everything they can to kind of stabilize this area right now if you look in the distance it's kind of hard to make out with all the smoke in the air but you can see that charred Hillside I mean these Flames came right down to the base of this shopping center right up against those homes up on the top I mean it's pretty incredible when you look at the work that firefighters did to save the property in this area of course their first priority is saving lives and that's what they were trying to do when they told people to go back up the hill back to their homes and to shelter in place while the fire came closer and closer but that good news that we've been reporting we just saw another Convoy of cars coming down uh those folks who were up there and told to shelter in place they've been making their way down this hill with uh police escorts and then making their way on to Sunset Boulevard and again I would tell you just looking at their faces you can tell they have been through a lot today I mean just the stress and the worry and the relief of finally being able to come down this hill and to finally evacuate uh everybody just looks relieved to be getting out of there so I want to show you we're kind of set the scene here so here's the bulldozzer that we believe or at least one of them that sort of bulldozed those cars out of the way to make room for emergency responders and for people who are evacuating it's just sitting here on standby as firefighters continue their work there a lot of activity coming up and down Palisades Drive uh fire officials that are coming back and forth police officers going back and forth again their goal is to get everybody who was up there to come down the mountain and to evacuate now and then also to make sure that this fire you know if any Embers are carried because of this crazy wind that they don't spark other spot fires and that they don't start setting more property on fire uh because again you know up when we look up this Canyon we have seen several I would say at least 10 very large plumes of black smoke which indicates that there are there is property that has been lost up somewhere at the top of Palisades Drive uh we haven't driven up there here's another example of that so if you look up in the sky you can see this kind of plom so I don't know what's back there I don't know what's over that Ridge but it looks like something is burning up there uh and if we look over here as well I mean you can just see again the smoke that's just being pushed down the mountain and here's another Convoy so this is what we keep talking about these are these residents who were told to go back up the hill police are going they're rounding them all up and then they're taking them down safely kind of you know in lines like this just making sure that everybody is safe so some good news for these residents but really A harrowing day for everybody who's been here I'll send it back to you guys all right Chelsea Edwards thank you we're looking at a live picture right now from Ed lascos and his crew who is joining our coverage now for the first time Ed talk about where you are and what you're seeing this is something we don't want to see it means now that this fire burning within the village of the Palisades have a heard in Antioch across here a lot of these whole old homes this is Antioch we are just south of the crosh several of these homes Up in Flames they started smoldering a little while ago from all the burning embers coming off the Hillside and now you've got one 2 3 four at least five of these homes burning out of control the wind swirling down here whipping the Flames around next block over some more homes and now that you just saw a few minutes ago with the uh we had a a Transformer electrical Transformer explode over there this is all out of control burning embers all over the place whipped around by those winds and this is something if you're familiar with the Palisades Village this is a block just behind Gelson's the main center of the The Village Village itself a lot of these home homes been here for decades and now they're Treeline streets Antioch right over here it is burning you can hear it popping active fire all out of control no firefighters here this is this is just uh something where you're left to the the the whims of Nature and these winds blowing the Embers all the way through last half hour or so the wind's really picking up here and as mic has been showing you our photographers you see all the smoke blowing through I'm sure you can also see some of the the burning embers too but these homes burning it is a wild wild fire an out of control blasting Wildfire look at all these Embers blowing through here unbelievable scene this is in the Palisades Village again about a block south of Gelson's right in the heart of the village itself we were hoping in this area that the fire would stay up on the hillside itself to the north side of of uh Sunset Boulevard that was the hope but now the fire is really roaring here the heat coming back we're going to pull back here a little bit Mikey because the Embers are really becoming dangerous and as these Embers blow up through there are some more homes obviously right off to the other side they are at risk too again this is Antioch it is a block south of hather about two blocks south of sunset right behind the Gelson in the heart of the Palisades Village the fire here burning out of control Ed I want to give you a second to catch your breath and maybe we can just take this sound full and listen in to the sound coming off of Mike aro's camera for a moment [Music] so you can hear those ferocious winds and you can hear the destruction um Ed lasos says we bring you back into this Ed I know you know this neighborhood the palisad so well can you talk about this community the character of this community whoa and now we're looking at power lines this is this is especially dangerous um talk about the community if you can yeah I will but I was going to mention also the power line some of the firefighters are going by here a little while ago there's still some folks in this area who haven't left and they've been on the loudspeaker telling them oh as we have some more of the uh Transformers blowing up here they were warning people to watch out for the down power lines thinking that they are still energized and as the fire hits the Transformers the wires come down that even brings yet another situation but to your point Alex just the Palisades very quiet uh Community uh lots of children through here the folks come here and they set up their homes because they there scho good schools in the area uh very peaceful not much of a crime we don't really get out here and do many stories because there's not much of a a crime situation here and then you have a fire like this that starts burning on the hill and as you can see these winds ripping right down antio and there's no way to stop them firefighters have no way of controlling this and it's just one home after the other as it goes down toward the ocean and I was going to show Mikey Mikey can you look at this over here this is interesting here's a spotf this is the home right across the street look at this that's how these things happen the EMB remember we saw them blowing it's now into that hedge burning this home and that without any firefighters down here is probably going to threaten and blow over and catch this hedge on fire this vegetation and these homes are going to be on at risk too but look how quickly just a little Ember like that gets going there's a big pine tree right overhead this whole area looks like a bomb a war zone look at this I'm standing in I can't even believe it so no no firefighters that you see on the street right now no there are no firefighters here at all but again it's not a cracker slap at the firefighters they've got their hands full look at those burning embers down at the bottom of the street look at that my goodness right so everybody is down here I don't see any more of the residents down here there are some folks were driving around taking pictures going up here watch out but yeah watch over to your left there sir this thing this hedge is really going over there now so it doesn't take long matter of seconds it's going there's another spot fire on the other side so this home and the home right next to it threatening as well but no we haven't seen any firefighters down here but what could they do look at this you see all these Embers big pieces chunks of the palm trees blowing through here the wind blowing through it looks like just somebody turned on the gas on your stove and it's just roaring roaring out of control and and you said that the residents they've thank goodness they've evacuated no one's there watch out the no yeah watch out Yeah well yeah let's back up with these wires are also popping there's that ember off to the left there look at that that's that hedge remember we saw that just about 2 3 minutes ago it's going that home my goodness is threatened as well but no Mar to your point we have not seen any residents couple of folks here with their little cameras out perhaps with social media or something they're taking some pictures but no we haven't seen luckily any any folks around here was a few folks on Sunset going through the village itself earlier oh there goes that house or what's left of it all the way down at the end of that block luckily most of this area and again we are just behind Gelson's the heart of the village of the Palisades it's evacuated and this Street Antioch just below Havoc heard several homes 5 six by my count burning several more threatened what a picture uh as we keep pointing out that the winds are just going to pick up you know we're nearing the 5:00 hour this fire broke out at 10:30 this morning as just 10 acres it's now close to 1300 I'm sure it's well above that we haven't an update in a couple of hours and we're just seeing that this is one Street in the Palisades as Eda said this is the heart of it right behind the gson yeah and look how quickly that fire like right here as Ed just showed us that was almost nothing a few seconds ago and let's hope that that does not turn into a fire right there to that house but there's really nothing to stop it and this is the challenge for firefighters during these events we saw this happen in 2018 during the woy fire uh which also exploded in size and was one of the worst fires in Southern California when there's This ferocious of winds able to take Embers in this many directions this quickly there are simply not enough firefighters to be everywhere at all times and so what happens is they have to pick and choose and what happens is you have a street like this where there are no firefighters because they're busy somewhere else guarding another Street and then half the block is gone in a matter of minutes uh it is the night May scenario uh for neighbors and residents and this has got to be so sickening I'm imagining for the residents who may be living on this street and watching our stream or watching this on a different station and knowing that uh their home is now burning and there's nobody there to stop it the good news is the people are out uh the tough news though for these people is there's really nothing that can be done to stop this at least in the interim because some streets at this point just because of the numbers are going to burn and some streets are going to be protected and sometimes it just is lucky in being in the right place at the right time and it's often times marlot we see on these streets where one or two homes or three homes burn and then across the street the home is fine um and so unfortunately for the people that live right here their home is not going to be fine I mean just a picture that looks like something literally Straight Out of Hell um as as now the Sun starts to go down uh and these images are going to be all the more ominous as we see these Flames um and it's going to be dark outside and it's going to be lit up um by these these orange uh pictures and this black smoke it is 450 so we are just minutes away until the official sunset uh this is just one Street in the Palisades this is Antioch Street this gives you an idea of how destructive those winds are how destructive the Flames are you talk about numbers and being outsized by the flames afd has just over 250 Personnel firefighters on the scene to tackle this fire that is quickly growing out of control and they even made that a point at the press conference that we heard them uh deliver just over an hour almost hour and a half ago at 3:30 they said it's burned 1,262 Acres but we know that the worst is yet to come we heard that from multiple officials out there there's 46 engines they have five helicopter lfd themselves then there's those super scoopers there's the issue of my goodness you see that flame those Flames getting more and more intense the power lines Ed go ahead go ahead yeah they they you're right holding on these we just got a big gust as you could see it here Mikey good idea get get the back back but uh Alex you were saying it's like it's like the balls of hell you're looking into those gust come through and it's just a wall of flames right down the street itself South more homes catching off to the left left uh where maybe we were looking at that hedge that top of the Hedge is now burning and I think it's actually cut the top of that home on fire so there is just nothing you can do at this point this fire roaring out of control and even if there were firefighters here to your point earlier how are you going to stop this you've got these Embers burning all over the place you can hear the Transformers the gas tanks exploding as this fire Roars down this street there's no stopping it at this point and these winds here comes another big Gust in the last 10 minutes or so they were steady but we've been getting more of the gust the Sund Downer winds coming com through and that's even just Fanning these Flames even more look at that look at the Embers look at it just blowing it through like crazy and you've been doing this for many years um this has got to be one of the worst you've ever seen yeah very much so and usually when you see this to be honest with you Fire Control can keep it up they do a great job keeping it in the hills in the mountains above the communities itself and when this started earlier I was thinking the same thing that those brave men and women with their strike teams and the air drops would keep it up keep it from jumping over Sunset but I never imagined these winds which would carry these Embers sometimes a mile or two uh just below this I've never seen anything like this especially in a very tight area like this you know a metropolitan area usually you see it in the canyons down in Orange County or something like that but here Palisades The Village my God yeah and we think about the Franklin fire Marlo when you and I were on the air until 4:00 in the morning a few weeks ago uh when it this was burning in Malibu and the fear was that this would happen happened there and in fact um it largely didn't um there there were some areas that were impacted but a lot of the worst of it these sort of images which we feared were happening didn't happen there but now it is happening in Pacific Palisades the number of structures lost for this is already significantly more than what we saw uh for that Franklin fire which was the last time we had a wind event similar to this one yeah it it looked really bad as we brought you that coverage but it turned out to be not so bad it could have been a lot worse but this on the other hand looks terrible and it is terrible and it's going to get worse uh the the Personnel from lafd certainly outnumbered by the strength of the Winds uh they do have I was talking a little earlier about at their disposal in terms of aircraft they do have five helicopters there are those super scoopers that we saw do some great work earlier they were dipping into the Pacific Ocean to make those water drops the super scoopers we saw two of them they were they are able to carry about 1,600 gallons of water uh per drop that makes a significant impact but the question is flying at night is a whole another thing a lot of times they cannot and Governor Nome was making the point that it's not just that the aircraft can't handle the turbulence from the winds it's that the fire retardant just is gets splashed all the way around and it does doesn't make an efficient drop and so it's sort of useless that was the point that he was making earlier uh so the firefight mainly from the ground at this point and just to get a handle on it on it obviously there's 0% containment we've talked about we haven't talked about the cause at this point um it could have been caused by anything there was one person who said that on New Year's Day there was concern about fireworks and there was a small brush fire that o that ignited that was quickly put out uh was this caused by fireworks it's way too early to tell uh but nonetheless it is here and it is getting worse and with these winds you don't need much uh of a flame to start a fire and once it starts as we see it's almost impossible to stop it um you can stop it in certain areas but you can't stop all of it and while this is happening at Ed's location we know cuz we saw Matthew seedorf a short time ago there's more fires uh more uh structures burning at his location we saw uh structures d d uh in in danger at Chelsea Edwards location uh we got structures burning in ch Christy bardo's location those are at least four different areas and that's just where our crews are there may be more Burning uh in some of the more remote areas as well that we can't get to right now that fire Crews frankly may not even know uh is happening uh because there is so much happening at the same time we are in that sort of fog of War Phase of this uh where uh everybody's doing their best to save lives um but you know not all the information is always totally accurate because people are in crisis mode and we are in the midst of that crisis certainly this particular street is um this is you know an area that we've been talking to Residents although it is uh you know so close and in danger of burning a lot of the residents we've spoken with say that it hasn't burned in decades um and unfortunately that is now happening the thing they've all been fearful of uh at the the same time so we're looking at the live picture on the ground on the top left of your screen is a live picture from our Santa Monica cam uh I believe or actually this is from our station uh in West LA uh our rooftop looking um this is our view from the station um you get a sense of of that and and it's not only impacting obviously all these homes but uh air quality uh for the entire uh west side of of certainly Los Angeles and Beyond is going to be impacted by all that smoke and the traffic um in the already congested West Side uh is especially bad uh tonight because of of these fires and road closures and all the rest of it we certainly saw that near our station here firsthand but that's all secondary um to the efforts to protect life and the efforts to try to protect property but some of those efforts are in vain as we watch these homes continue to burn yeah as we do that let's remind you of the evacuation centers that are in place if you have small animals you can go to the Westwood Rec Center that's between uh that's on saula between Wilshire and Ohio The Dream Center has also opened up its doors that's in Hollywood the Dream Center and then if you have large livestock Pierce College is also taking uh your animals uh and that's the same case with Ellie County Animal Shelter as you can see on your screen on Agora Road in Agora so Pierce College in Woodland Hills taking large Liv stock in the Ellie County Animal Shelter in Agora that is taking the small pets there so those are the evacuation centers that are set up for tonight we've heard from a lot of the residents who obviously they've lived there for a long time they have friends that live in nearby Brentwood and uh and they're able to seek some reprieve there for the night so two live pictures two very stunning live pictures the one on the smaller picture is from the roof of our studios here in West Los Angeles at Fox 11 you can see the active flames and the massive plume of smoke enveloping the skyline on this Tuesday evening and then also the bigger picture here this is Antioch Street in the City of Pacific Palisades by the way just population of just some 23,000 people who live here and already more than 13 00 Acres have burned since 10:30 this morning yeah let's take you this is a live picture right now from LAX um where I believe Air Force One I think is still parked uh and this is the image if you imagine coming into Los Angeles we even flying out of Los Angeles and this is what you see as you come in that massive plume of smoke that gives you a sense I mean this is miles and miles away from this uh which gives you a sense of how B big uh that smoke is and how many people are seeing it in their evening commute tonight and uh people flying in and out and and we don't have any reports of major delays but still challenging I would imagine um to be flying um in uh you know in an out of Los Angeles tonight as well with the winds that everybody is dealing with and again the worst of the winds are still to come later tonight we want to pause for a moment as we welcome everybody at the top of the hour you are watching the Fox 11 News at 5:00 um which is simoc cast on both Fox 11 and Fox 11 plus uh good evening I'm Alex Michaelson and I'm marot tees we've been on the air with you since taking over for the crew on Good Day LA since 2:30 this afternoon and our coverage continues here's what we know about the Pacific Palisades fire simply called the Palisades fire almost 1300 Acres burned 0% contained 30,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders 10,000 homes threatened we just went over some of those evacuation centers I'll do so again the Westwood rec center in Westwood the Dream Center in Hollywood Pierce College in Woodland Hills for large livestock and the LA animal uh County Center in Agora Hills for the smaller pets Westwood Rec Center is also taking the smaller pets if you are just joining us on Fox 11 plus where we are now just beginning our coverage uh I know many of you have been joining us on Fox 11 there are other folks that are streaming us right now on the fox Local app we thank you for joining us and it just get you caught up what we're looking at right now is one of the most devastating wildfires that we have seen in Southern California in several years uh we know of at least 20 different structures that we've personally witnessed uh that have burned um today that number could rise eyes um that's just our crews trying to get a sense of what they're seeing on the ground um and there is an active firefight going on and in some places homes are just burning uh we want to welcome you inside our our state our studio and just uh let you know that we have live team coverage uh that we are going to be on commercial free throughout the night with you um to help guide you uh through this life-threatening situation we've got reporters all over Southern California including our Matthew seedorf um who joins us right now um and uh Matthew I know you have seen far too many homes burning not sure if Matthew can hear us yeah I don't know we we're having some issues with our with our microphone out you can see the massive fire we were out here about 30 minutes ago the firefighters are doing their best trying to contain this home specifically with water but if you uh hand over to the Matthew despite your best efforts we're having a hard time with the mic uh so it's hard to hear you we're sorry about that maybe Matthew uh if if you can stand right in front of the camera cuz the only thing we're getting you from is the uh camera mic um so maybe if if you talk right to that we might be able to hear you yeah can you hear me on the uh the N mic right now yeah so just talk loud yeah you can okay good so basically we rejoined you about 30 minutes ago firefighters were actually trying to put out the flames on this home off wman Lane uh since then they've lost water pressure on the hydrant so basically this fire is just growing out of control and there's at least three or four homes on this street alone that are without uh you know trying to get water on top of the homes that are on fire um I would estimate that we've seen probably more than a dozen homes uh at least damaged by Flames today but it's not a good situation um as the wind continue to pick up right now yeah uh you you've you've really been in the thick of it all day long uh at one point even picking up the hose yourself and trying to put out a Spotfire all right you stay safe we'll check in with you when we can Matthew thank you let's go to our chief meteorologist Adam Krueger you've been warning about these destructive winds since last week Adam yeah I mean it was a concerning weather setup it looked like it was going to be that way since last week we're seeing it play out right now and really the big story going forward from this point is the fact that the winds will get stronger tonight and and Peak really late tonight through early tomorrow morning one thing I thought was interesting I just had a couple notes I wrote down as we were watching Ed lasos his live shot just a few minutes ago um you know we saw he was reporting there there were some gusts of bursts of wind that started happening as he was reporting there's going to I think that's just the beginning of the ramp up of the Winds by the way I'm going to animate this going forward moment but I think that's just the beginning of the Winds ramping up so we're going to see more of those bursts start to happen over the next several hours another thing we saw near Ed was one of the emers just flew right across where he was standing and then we saw a bush light on fire and it was basically it reminded me of like the demonstrations you see online or what the fire department will do showing what can happen with a Christmas tree and they'll do a demonstration in a parking lot of how quickly it will become engulfed and that's what it reminded me of it was just kind of amazing to see that happen and play out in real time also where he's reporting from Den L populated area not like it's on the border of her neighborhood there's homes all around it and I was looking at the map you know we've been talking about the 12200 or so Acres um being marked as as least how much how much acreage has burned so far but where he was reporting from with some of the homes on fire that was like six or seven streets over from the border of the 1200 Acres so it'll be interesting to see when the next update comes out from the officials as to what the acreage would be and we know it's going to be higher but it it might be substantially higher from what I'm seeing um and and again you know now as we look at the forecast year we're going to see those winds just kind of really ramp up so here we are starting right about now I've got the Pacific Palisades marked right here but also you'll see big numbers on many other parts of the map as well here's a look at 7:00 this evening here's 9:00 this evening now look at the DraStic increase in the forecast wind gust now keep in mind these are gust not sustained winds there's a difference there gust would be just how strong the winds could be in instantaneous moments just like a burst that might get up over 60 MPH so that's what these numbers mean sustained winds will still be really high maybe something like 30 40 mph sustained winds which would be like the average wind speed over a couple minutes so again here's 9:00 tonight now as we go through the night I think the winds are going to hold at that strength pretty much all night long here's a look at 2 a.m. we see big numbers all across the area not just around the Palisades but a lot of the mountains north of La valleys as well look at Burbank our model says near 70 mph gust there for example going into at 4:00 in the morning it's basically the exact same story here's 9:00 tomorrow morning we see some differences in some spots but it's just widespread purple which is not good that means very strong wind gusts we see the high numbers for example 70 at the Pacific Palisades and something I mentioned earlier today is this is a computer model this is a projection doesn't mean the winds are going to exactly play out like this but it gives us a really good indication as to what type of uh you know wind speeds we're looking at it may differ a little bit but you get the idea really strong winds and the same wind direction basically from the Northeast uh throughout this whole event now here we go into the end of the day Wednesday this is 6 p.m. and this is a crucial point because 6: p.m. tomorrow is when the high wind warnings expire across our area so that means we passed the worst of it but still red flag conditions continue into Thursday relative humidity we've seen those below 10 or below 20% in some spots today it's tomorrow when we expect the air to actually get even drier so relative humidity we've seen those below 10 or below 20% in some spots today it's tomorrow when we expect the air to actually get even drier so two things working against us here one is the winds get stronger tonight and into tomorrow morning the other thing is the humidity will be going down even more tomorrow with some spots below 10% I also want to point out one more thing uh before I send it back to you guys so we've been talking about the Red Flag Warning it's widespread for today and tomorrow and notice that the banner here I put for some areas Thursday so let me switch from Tuesday Wednesday now I'm just highlighting areas that are under a Red Flag Warning just on Thursday so there's a little spot here from around La South where that's carved out but still it's a widespread Red Flag Warning even though the wind will be a little bit lower here still a widespread Red Flag Warning on Thursday um so again strongest winds still to come tonight just to kind of like summarize everything and the air gets even a little bit drier tomorrow and and you know we've seen video of these Embers flying around things are catching on fire all over the place really really difficult situation for those involved to try to mitigate the fire it's going to be really tough even from the air with the winds blowing this strong anything they might drop just gets blown away before it hits its Target really really tough uh next 24 hours ahead of us Adam the the scary thing that you're talking about cuz we just looked at that map uh we're not just talking about Pacific Palisades so it it it is very possible almost likely that we could have another fire in another area with the winds the way that they are yeah you know you go into these scenarios we we had a similar kind of weather setup back in December back in November we know the big fires that ignited from those but that's just up to chance it's like wherever it's going to happen it's going to happen and and the environment that we have around the Palisades exists yes everywhere across Southern California so one little you know spark or some small fire somewhere could lead to another situation like what we're seeing play out right now yeah and to check the calendar it was December 9th that the Franklin fire erupted that was in Malibu that burned just over 4,000 that could have been worse uh just 20 structures destroyed I say just given that we thought it was going to be a whole lot worse as we're now seeing nighttime video of the Flames of the Palisades fire before that November it was November 6th at the mountain fire in Ventura County erupted that was very very destructive with almost 250 structures destroyed and now here we are each month there's been a significant fire incident and we have the Palisades fire erupting on January the 7th and now we're almost to 1300 at last check this is an ominous picture I think this is elasco picture because you were just on Antioch Street behind the gson and here you are are you still on Antioch yes yeah we start exact location Marl this fire as the winds whipped through here really is turned into well turned into hell on Earth my goodness look at that this is Antioch cross here is haford we are about a block behind Gilson's the alarming thing is the wind swirls Mikey will give you a look at that home after home right down Antioch burning nothing here to stop it the Flames the winds and we get a good look at it now because mostly it's covered in a lot of Thick Smoke as the winds swirl around here but this is extremely alarming not because you're watching homes live but the Hope from fire command is they we're going to keep these Flames north of sunset not let them jump over we're right along to Mescal Canya that runs along P high right down the PCH itself and now you can see clearly the Flames with these Embers have jumped Sunset and now burning through this neighborhood several homes here lost others over on the far another one of the Transformer blowing Mikey over here to the right in that area through the smoke that's another area that's right down along to meso right across from the high school itself look at the Flames through there you can see them through all the smok as that thin smoke as it blows through so it's basically one spot fire after another to Adam's point the winds here in the last 20 minutes really you get some very very strong gust and when that happens it's like raining lit Sparks lit lit Embers I'm sorry another blast of the wind came blowing a lot of dust and debris and everything else at us but look as look at look what the these high gust due to those flaves just whip them up even more ferociously as they threaten to jump across antiac itself over there that is the area that is right along T mesal right over by P High Palisades High School that is threat this whole area certainly is under evacuation notices we haven't seen anybody here other than some folks coming around with their with their cameras uh social media type but everybody else is evacuated no power in most of the area Transformers exploding lines coming down the fire department going around telling everybody be careful about the lines that they come down because they're most likely energized very dangerous very deadly but these gust look at those Flames we're getting another big gust through here it really obscures your view with all the thick smoke but it just whips those Flames up even higher I was thinking before when you get even a halfway down the block you could feel the intense heat coming around especially the wind starts to blow it in your direction and look at some of the debris blowing and I think you can even see look at all the Sparks the Embers is blowing from right to left on your screen blowing across we earlier we showed you about last half hour there was a hedge across the street large hedge maybe 6 7t high that caught on fire it's burnt now alongside luckily that the home itself to my view hasn't hasn't lit up on fire that's the good news there but all the way down the street even as I bend around this side to the left it's nothing but one home after another burning fire department again nowhere in sight they've got their hands full in some other areas but again there are so many spot fires burning up here we see this section of Antioch over there on tesil the right and then some other sections along Sunset but the really frightening part of this is the Flames with these winds and the Embers has jumped across Sunset now burning on the south side of sunset being pushed by these gusts being pushed down toward PCH itself Ed lasos thank you what what a picture yeah uh absolutely devastating let's check in with uh christe vardo she has another look now that the sun has set Chrissy looks like you're working to make sure your microphone's on you hear me can you hear me we can hear you now christe go ahead I apologize we're having some technical problems I just got word the senior center is burning and I'm actually a block away from where Ed is and you can tell how dark it is there's so much smoke but there's actually an apartment building that's now on fire here on Sunset Boulevard and for a couple of hours we had not seen any firefighters but they did come in here with several engines and they're tackling that apartment fire as we speak I also saw a home burning down on Radcliffe and havenford so quite a few things are on fire and if we P this way I can show you that's the gson just just to give you an idea of where we are and we're standing in the parking lot of the 76 station and someone from the gas station has been out watering the parking lot now for a couple of hours in fact he's still here with his hose and even though it looks like this he has not evacuated although he told me he will at some point and about 2 minutes ago right before you came out live to me we saw a whole stream of cars apparently some hold outs now have decided it is time to get out as this fire keeps burning and pushing in our Direction and again we are at vi de laaz and sunset so we're smack dab in the middle of the palisad village and this is the scene right now you can see how dark the sky is you can also probably hear the gust of wind and for a couple of hours we've been hearing fire alarms go off but it appears that the power is now out we're not hearing those smoke alarms and those fire alarms going off any longer but we do know that an apartment complex a very large one is now on fire let's send it back to you christe thank you so much for that uh Haley wiow she's on the ground you were at the command post earlier where are you now hey there yes we are just down the road from basically where the press conference happened with Governor Nome and the chief both of police and fire they had some really big mobile command post big rigs kind of thing that they had to move in so they asked us to move down the parking lot but check it out out you guys those are the flames right there and the smoke is incredible I mean it's almost enveloping the entire sky here uh we're just at Will Rogers State Beach still off of the PCH here um the ocean's literally on the other side of this parking lot and the Press are wrapped up probably a half hour ago I did just talk to Eric Scott though a few minutes ago he's of course the Pio of lafd and I said if there's one message that you want to get out to the public what would you want to say and he said don't ever abandon your car like people did today he said it was a disaster they had to bring in a bulldozzer to literally remove the cars and he said of course you know if there's flames in your car that's one thing but unless you absolutely have to never leave your vehicle like that or move it over to the you know obviously to the side of the road because it was a huge disaster for everybody behind those parked cars it was gridlocked so and they couldn't get in the First Responders so uh we've got some video of those cars um showing people just literally getting out and uh there was I think we said earlier today a hundred people walking um and he said what often happens is you know somebody panics they see somebody else walking and it was kind of just a domino effect but it was a really really big chaotic mess for firefighters trying to get into the fire um and of course those Vehicles left behind behind he said we don't mess around we brought in a bulldozer and uh remove them so that's the one thing that he wanted to say you know of course I asked him about this fire and we asked Governor Nome what's the plan what's the plan in place with the the worst winds yet to come tonight starting at 10 p.m. um and the the fire is moving Southwest right now of course with these big Northeast winds and he said that uh they basically they've got all boots on the ground they do have more aircraft so I have a couple of close friends who were in the fire trapped and they said please ask him why are we're not seeing more helicopters and more tankers uh more aircraft in the sky and about four different people at that press conference touched on that and they said you know we can fly around all day and not do anything um the the aircraft can handle these winds the problem is they're retardant they have to be able to aim correctly on the fire on the Flames or it's just useless and Governor Nome actually had some really interesting input about that he said um with AI with technology they've got some incredible game-changing um technology down the road that will really help with these Wildfire fights of course that's not you know good news for people today but um but they do have boots on the ground obviously here in our region and then they have resources coming from Northern California of course calfire and then they can always bring in resources they said from other states if need be so they are according to them on top of this and you know I said this is only one fire you know what if another Wildfire breaks out similar to this one tonight when the winds pick up and they of course have a plan in place ready for that too with more resources on the way reporting live here in Will Rogers State Beach I'm Haley Winslow I'll send it back to you guys Haley do we know why the people started abandoning the cars or what was the oh sorry hey Marley you have something you want to share well no go ahead go I I'll go go ahead Mar there there were concerns there's a lot of reports and you're looking at it online that the Getty Villa the precious Getty Villa was on fire we're working to confirm that there are some images online that show uh the the vegetation around the Villa uh engulfed in flames we're just getting word that the CEO of the Villa says that the staff remains safe and the artart collection remains safe safe pardon me uh though trees and vegetations on the site have burned so it doesn't seem that the actual museum has caught fire the statement goes on to say irrigation was immediately deployed throughout the grounds Tuesday Morning Museum Galleries and library archives were sealed off from Smoke by state-of-the-art air Handling Systems and the double walled construction of the galleries also provides significant protection for those collections wow and lastly the Getty Villa will remain closed to the public through at least Monday so it seems that the Getty Villa itself has been spared at this point but we will be checking on that Haley I want to let you answer that question we saw all those cars out there do we know like what started the first person to say I'm abandoning my car do we have any background on that so I thought it was you know there had to be flames coming into the car I know from a boating background you never leave the boat unless you have to and it's kind of the similar situation you know Eric Scott said don't ever leave your car unless there are literally like flames in your car um and so he said you know during a fire there's two kinds of people there's the person who's cool common collected and it's like oh it's just another fire we dealt with this dozen times before and it obviously gets much worse than they expect and then there's the second person who just panics and he believes that it was somebody who just panicked and you know thought I'm not getting anywhere I can't get anywhere I got to get out I got to get to my house or or get out or get out of the way wherever they were trying to go um but instead of like moving off the road out of traffic they just literally parked their car in the road and then what happened was when everyone else followed suit there was a massive backup behind them and First Responders couldn't get through yeah we've seen those images throughout the afternoon and I heard those reports earlier that people they were so frustrated that they were literally gridlocked and stopped with nowhere to go that that is why that they got out of let's go to Chelsea Edwards she is close to the Getty Villa Chelsea what can you tell us I mean look at what we're seeing here so we're standing on PCH we drove down Sunset and took a left I I mean look at this whatever this was now completely destroyed I believe that we're south of the Getty Villa though but when you look up the canyon you can see what looks like colums which I know we see at the Getty Villa but again I don't think that that's where we are it is so hard to get oriented here because of this Thick Smoke it's just hard to tell where you are but again we drove South on Sunset Boulevard took a left on PCH and that's where we are now now if we look to the South you can see fire Personnel down there you can see how it actually has jumped or it appears to have jumped PCH down in the distance from where we're standing here again very hard to tell because it's just so dark and so soupy I mean it's just it's like night time out here I mean it is night time out here but you can barely see anything but look at these Flames so it looks like there was a Structure here on the bottom ground kind of near PCH and then you go up into the Hillside and something very large is burning up there we keep hearing what sounds like things collapsing like wood falling onto itself um some things just falling all over the place up there very loud sounds of things collapsing so not sure exactly what's burning but something very large up there and again you can see this wind just pushing off into the ocean we're standing right up against the beach here on PCH and you see these Embers flying as well these are large Embers I mean the good news is obviously you've got the ocean right here so there's nothing to burn when it gets to this side of PCH and nothing further than that but I mean everything on this Hillside is charred now I want to show you to the north as well if we can do this Elliot so it looks like everything to the north of this area has already burned you can see a lot of those Embers some hot spots that are kind of up in that area now near where we're standing is a mobile home park and we're getting reports that there are mobile homes in that Park kind of up on that Hill side there that are on fire I we've not confirmed those independently um but we have been hearing that so we're going to head in that direction in just a bit and see what we can find there I believe it's called the Malibu Village mobile home park but that's kind of right where we're standing but look at these large spotfires I mean you've got some brush that looks like it's on fire there um lots of smoke coming off of all of this again it looks like a lot of this is already burned here along PCH which you know is good news it looks like we're in a safe spot at least right here this is all just charred Hillside but whatever this is obviously a total loss whatever above it is a total loss oh and then let's look to the South Elliot see this big looks like we just got a big cloud covering it big thing of smoke but there was another fire I just saw to the South we can see those Flames kind of poking out do you see that not sure what that is but this is where it looks like it jumped PCH um and is now burning kind of on both sides again the good news obviously there's nothing on this side of PCH um there's nothing left here to burn but you can see those Embers kind of crossing the parking lot as well here at the beach just incredible images another thing I just want to point out we've got three American flags that are posted just on that side you can see them right across PCH those are still intact everything around them has burned uh the structure to the to the back of it has burned the hillside all around it has burned but those three American flags remain up and untouched as of now wow but look again at these structures you see these big large beams just being consumed they're falling I mean this is just look at these Embers as well look at that just raining down on this parking lot on the beach just I've never seen anything like this I mean we've been covering these fires for for years here in Los Angeles and this is just this is on another level definitely one of the worst of all time that we are witnessing in real time together Chelsea Edwards um and photographer Elliot Mendoza thanks for your great work out there uh we want to bring in the conversation right now cie who joins us on the phone I was just asking Haley Winslow about why did people abandon their cars what sparked that well she's one of those people that was stuck in the middle of that and she can give us some answers on what was happening uh cie um thanks so much for being with us walk us through what happened hi thank you so much um my husband went to go pick up my daughter from Calvary on palisad drive and the fire was just way too close on both sides of palisad drive that people were scared for their lives so they got out of their cars to go down and then I live up in the highlands and tried to drive down and because people abandoned their cars I wasn't able to get down so I drove my car back up um and took a bicycle all the way down the hill and people in my neighborhood on Monte Alto Street are actually still in their homes because they don't think it's safe enough to go down Palisades Drive well hopefully we can show that video of the car so people know what we're talking about here it is um these are cars that were abandoned and then fire Crews had no way to get up the street so they brought in a bulldozzer and then moved them all to the side and total a lot of the cars in the process so is is your car one of these Callie are you still there yes I'm still here so as far as I understood your story you were going to get stuck in the backup of people abandoning their cars but you turned your car around went back to location a and got your bike and then rode your bike down so you didn't end up having to abandon your car as others did is that right no but my husband was one that he also went down and he had to abandon his car I see I see because the Flames were just coming too too close what is your status currently tonight um I'm staying at a hotel in Santa Monica and praying my house doesn't burn down is your family safe your your your I think you said your daughter and your husband yes everybody's safe but I'm really concerned about my neighbors who are just Sheltering in place still because they don't think they can get down that road and they think this because of the the cars or because of the Flames the flames and the cars cuz everybody was turned away at one point and told to shelter in place wow and now we're looking at some video of of some of these cars that when they were moved by that bulldozzer and moving around like little toys I think about how strong that thing is there um so Cali how are you processing all of this I'm just happy that I'm with my family but of course it's very gutting to know that I don't have any of my belongings with me oh we're so so sorry to hear that uh how long have you been a resident of the paciific Palisades we actually moved from toena 3 years ago because I was so worried about the fires there oh gosh uh and traditionally the Palisades has been able to be spared from a lot of these fires for many many years um C can you talk about I obviously sounds like your husband experienced this really um just what the chaos was like of that moment with the cars and everybody being stuck and just what that felt like what people were saying so I was taking a bicycle down palisad drive and the palm trees in the middle of the road the tops were all on fire there were cars on fire it was very scary there was fire on both sides of the street I'm just grateful I got out did you get a formal evacuation warning from the city from lafd or did you make the call on your own no the there's not very good service up there right now so you made the call on your own yes my neighbors told me to stay and they're still there have you had contact with them since um yes and they said that they don't feel safe driving down palisad drive right now wow well uh hopefully maybe we can put some of those people in touch with rescue crews or or maybe firefighters or somebody who can help get them yes they're on Monty Alto Monty Alto okay maybe we can make that happen um all right we will we will uh do our best to pass that word along obviously they are pretty busy right now too um but we appreciate you sharing that word with us and we we uh we wish you the best and hope we can stay in in touch with you in the hours ahead and we hope that your home is spared Kelly thank you so much for being with us thank you it's now 5:30 uh you were watching the Fox 11 News at 5: um a night that we will not soon forget here in Southern California Alex Michaelson marotz here with you uh for the evening uh as we are watching the Palisades fire burn more than 1200 Acres uh threatening 10,000 more uh and we have seen probably at least two dozen structures burn if not more than that uh let's go to the ground uh I believe we're going to Chelsea Edwards on the ground uh and you're along PCH and you've seen some serious destruction behind you uh there was talk of you mentioned the big structure behind you that was burning this may be the villa de Leon that's what that's what it's looking like on the maps that certainly seems to match I mean look up there you can see those columns uh you see the fire just kind of shooting out of them right now that's certainly what it appears to be um again it's it's very hard to get oriented where we are just because of this thick black smoke come down a little bit Elliot you can see the structure just a few minutes ago that was standing whatever that was now it's just a few beams we just saw some huge collapses of some of the major uh structural beams there and there's hardly anything left there and if you go even further south on PCH I mean we're just seeing these big clouds of black smoke sweeping down the Hillside and coming toward the ocean not sure what it is up there that's burning but it looks like they're kind of repositioning a lot of their their firefighting efforts down this way we just saw a convoy of fire officials that just were rushing down PCH I see another one that's up in the distance coming down from the north uh and again you got like a police officer here so it seems that they're focusing some of their efforts now on this section which is south of Sunset Boulevard along PCH um and you know we're looking at these structures that are burning take a look up there you see a ridge now on fire the good news from where we're standing at least uh everything on this Hillside is already burned this is all charred you just see some Embers now but everything to the sides of it are are going up I mean that was nothing just a 60 seconds ago and now you can see that Ridge fully in engulfed now just up to the north a little bit you can see this wind as well I mean it's just just blowing uh now up there's a mobile home park that we have gotten reports that there are some structures that are on fire up there again we have not independently confirmed those we're not near any fire officials right now so haven't confirmed that but um again with the smoke that we're seeing and these sounds that we're hearing I mean just sounds like huge structures stones are falling down uh you just can't make out what's going on but I mean just something to behold here here again that structure is now gone there's nothing left of that and look at the just the furocity the verocity of this fire that's sweeping down toward the beach now look at that black smoke I mean whatever is burning up there is just completely engulfed in flames it's sweeping across PCH we saw it burning on the other side of PCH for a little while I mean there's nothing on this side really to burn other than some grass and then you've got the beach and the water so I mean that's the good news at least on this stretch there are no homes right where we're standing on this side of PCH of course you go north and south and that's not the case in other places so I assume that's what firefighters are are working on trying to protect some of the structures that are on PCH because this wind is certainly pushing the Flames that direction I mean they're coming down the mountain and then toward the ocean so you know it's hard to see what's happening down there we see a lot of emergency Personnel here's another part of that Convoy or at least a few other fire officials that are heading down there toward the South so that's kind of where it looks like a lot of the action is happening um just just quite a scene to behold I mean it is just wild up here you see a palm tree I don't know if you can see this Elliot but see up at the very top that's a tall palm tree up there that was on fire just a second ago you can see how parts of it are are burning it's you've got Embers kind of in the trunk of that palm tree and then up on the fronds as well so that's certainly a concern as well you know you get one of those palm fronds that is on fire and then gets carried in this wind I mean as we've said many times they can go up you know as far as 2 miles so you got homes all up and down PCH all up and in these hillsides as well I mean we're right in the Pacific Palisades Santa Monica just this way and then you've got Malibu up there so a lot of residential areas and when you look at things like that I mean there's no way that firefighters can do anything about that without air support I mean that is so tall when you look at the height of where those Embers are on that palm tree um so if you get those Embers you get those fronds that start flying around especially in these winds there's just nothing anybody can do I mean wherever they land you're just at that Mercy I mean there's there's there's no way to predict where they're going to go and there's no way to to fix it if they do land and catch something on fire so very dangerous situation out here and again we're seeing a lot more support I see more firefighters that are coming from the north down to the South down here on PCH to deal with whatever is happening down there so it appears that this fire is kind of moving in this this southwesterly direction um again kind of hard to get oriented on exactly where we are because it's just so hard to see the visibility is so low here but ju I mean look Ken just look at this it just keeps getting worse it seems like just structures back there whatever is back there hopefully everybody got out and was able to evacuate because this this whole Hillside is just gone Marlin Alex wow wow that that picture really speaks for itself and it looks like another structure may be burning there we want to show you some video from wow oh did you did you hear that explosion that sounded like a um I don't know what that was a Transformer or or something but that was l i I could feel that one actually feel the vibration from that one whatever that was was very large felt like we could feel that from here um all right Chelsea stay safe where you are uh let's show you this video if we can um so this is some video from a little earlier um where we see how close the Flames got at least in that video to the Getty Villa now in this video which was clearly posted to Tik Tok we don't see the actual Getty Villa burning we just see what's near the Getty Villa burning um and from what you said earlier Mara they they have not said that the the actual structure itself is burned right so to your point the Getty Villa is a massive complex uh the vegetation around it is burning but the president and CEO put out a statement saying that the staff and our collection remains safe uh and it's just some of those trees and vegetation on site that have burned so at this point and they have as you can imagine uh great protection given the museum the art collection inside the irrigation system they have on site so at this point all remains to be in one piece at the Getty Villa and here's another live look this this is Chelsea's camera and maybe let's let's just all be quiet for a moment and just try to listen in to the sounds of this right now that and listen to these winds I you can hear how dramatic that is uh in person and how Chelsea and photographer Elliot Mendoza doing a great job of even being able to stand up in all of that you see uh that it looks like a bunch of fire Crews have now arrived there if this is indeed right near the Getty Villa um you wonder if they're going to work to try to say that structure uh as as we've talked about you kind of have to prioritize and that may be one of the things that they're going to prioritize but you know we don't we don't know sometimes it gets so intense that you can't stop the fire and we have seeing that and look at this live picture wow as as it's gotten darker you know the dramatic image of that fire line um right in the middle of you know one of the more populated areas of Southern California um is just a a uh sort of awe inspiring and also scary sight um that picture coming to us from I believe our Santa Monica cam looking back uh towards Pacific Palisades let's go ahead and get a look at that forecast and the winds with chief meteorologist Adam Krueger uh this is when you expected those winds to pick up I I know the later we get the worse those winds will be traveling yeah you know what's interesting is a little while ago so just kind of like really dissecting what the computer model was showing and I'll have that in a second here but it was actually indicating around 5: to 6:00 p.m. just for like an hour that the winds would slightly back off and I'm looking at some of the weather instruments kind of near the Pacific Palisades there's not a good one right in the Heart of the City uh but actually some of these compared to about an hour ago the winds have come down about 10 miles hour so that little 5 to 6 p.m. window which we're in right now seems to maybe be playing out but then the winds will ramp up big time this evening I'll get to that in a moment I wanted to share this with you earlier though to give you some context you know people that have lived here a long time kind of get how it works around here with with these extreme events coming every now and then but if you're new here and you're wondering how rare it is to see what we have right now which is a PDS Red Flag Warning stands for particularly dangerous situation it was in 2020 when the National Weather Service started using this tag it's reserved for the most extreme events and from 20120 to the start of the Season that there was a gap where there was not a PDS Red Flag Warning then we had one in November you'll remember that was the fire around Camaro the Mountain Fire then we had another one in December that was the Franklin fire around Malibu and now we have the third one in this season issued which is I mean they're already rare they're kind of like every couple years if you want to just average it out we've had three already this season uh so what we're seeing this season is not normal for sure three of these major events just November December now January here with the one we're seeing right now okay so before we even get to the forecast winds we've got this Red Flag Warning that's today and tomorrow then we head into Thursday and still most of the area excluding a part of the LA Basin let's say most of the area is still in the red Flag Warning which means we're still seeing dangerous fire weather conditions but the worst of the Winds now through tomorrow morning and then the high wind warning ends at 6 p.m. tomorrow now we look at the forecast wind speed starting right about now here's Pacific Palisades but notice just as we look across the broad area going a little later into the evening 7:00 we're kind of around where we're at right now watch the DraStic increase when I move this forward from 700 p.m. to 9 p.m. we see the numbers get quite a bit higher we see the just overall coverage of the intense winds cover a lot lot more of the map and then from there on out we're just locked in to winds like this from let's say 9 or 10:00 tonight all the way into uh tomorrow morning so as I Advance this now here's 2 o'clock in the morning for example and this doesn't mean everywhere is going to have gusts over 60 at the same time but Winds of that nature will be possible and we're talking gusts not sustained winds but bursts of winds that could be up that strong uh many areas across Southern California could face these will face these types of winds with the very dry air uh now here's 4:00 in the morning still it's pretty extreme here we going to 10:00 in the morning it is still what I would call Extreme winds and then we go later into the day on Wednesday and you see the wind speeds uh back off a little bit you see the coverage of the highest winds kind of cover less ground as we head into 7 p.m. Wednesday so it's that point at which the high wind warning will end and this is the reason why but that doesn't mean we're totally in the clear there's still red flag conditions that continue into Thursday I also want to share with you the future humidity so we're looking at forecast relative humidity which we saw was below 20% today including in the Pacific Palisades when this fire started at 10:30 this morning now as we go into tomorrow here's another thing working against us is the air actually gets a little bit drier it's already very dry but the relative humidity as you see in many spots will be below 10% around midday tomorrow so the fact that it gets drier and the fact that the winds are only increasing as we go through tonight and tomorrow morning not a good scenario to say the least 10: p.m. to 5:00 a.m. is the window the National Weather Service says the winds will be at their Peak I still still think even until like 7 8 9:00 tomorrow morning they're going to be quite extreme again we're just bracing for those gusts over 60 for a large part of the area very very difficult situation we heard earlier in the press conference as I head back to you here that they said you know they can fly their aircraft in winds like this but whatever they drop it's not going to do much good when the winds are this strong it just gets blown away from their intended target all right uh Adam Krueger thank you we'll check in with you in a second uh let's go back out to Fox 11's Matthew seedorf and Matthew a not great update when it comes to P High yeah we just drove right past Pal's Charter High School and there are portions of the building up in flames right now we right outside the school and see uh we can walk across the street this is towards the football stadium I believe that is the score box on fire as we're going to turn this way with all these these Embers fly um I do have an anomer with me it's measuring measuring winds gusting to 35 40 miles per hour um with flames on the other side of the street as well see if we can push this way um and I'm actually with photojournalist Sam Dubin you went to this High School Sam if you don't mind what's this like uh it's heartbreaking uh this is my M uh the baseball Field's totally gone some of the buildings are gone this uh house across the streets gone uh this is the newer Aquatic Center the uh Maggie Gilbert aquatic Center looks okay right now the classrooms appear okay but it's just a heartbreaking for everyone who went to this school a lot of uh a lot of people have gone here over the years yeah I can't imagine um just seeing that especially as a as your Alma moer and uh we're looking at looks like the pool right now and then looking across the street as we're battling these winds um more buildings have burned down um and just this thick black smoke again winds it just stings cuz of all this debris flying around um looking at myometer gust 25 miles hour right now but we've seen probably close to 40 um just uh it's hard to put this into words seeing this home up here on fire and all these other structures and even a high school I'll go ahead and send it back to you yeah we were hearing earlier that the gym was impacted and now we're seeing just utter destruction of P High School we're so sorry uh we know that obviously thousands of kids go there and Sam duin our photographer is an alma modder so as he described it he said it was heartbreaking to see it go up in Flames the Aquatic Center is new that looks like that is holding strong at this point but as we know that could all change uh in the blink of an eye across the street that massive home uh fully engulfed in flames and we're still the winds obviously as he was measuring on his own Matthew cedor at least 25 miles hour Matthew you look like you're a man on a mission right now what are you seeing where you going to yeah just trying to take a look at this home um we know that a lot of people had trouble evacuating so you're just thinking about that and uh obviously just starting of the new year and seeing this right now and all these homes are destroyed up basically you can just see the chimney sticking out there but just looking around um just surrounded by Flames at this point um if you want to flip that way Sam looking back back towards the high school itself you can see more Flames up the road and we just showed you the the football stadium um and just the wind uh it stings like I was saying hard to hard to put this in the words what we're what we're experiencing and seeing out here and just driving making the drive back down to where we are we're just up the mountain probably 10- minute drive but there's just spot fires uh between here and there so just seeing all these structures and and homes and people's lives burning right now is uh all their belongings and stuff it's just it's hard to see yeah looking at the history of the school it was founded in 1961 it was built for $6 million on a filled in Canyon and now we're seeing that Canyon being engulfed in flames almost 3,000 people are enrolled students at P High School which is now Burning uh live on our air tonight and can we tell are the classrooms themselves burning so I'll let Sam as answer that question because he's familiar with the school they're they're curious if the classrooms themselves Are Burning uh I don't think the classrooms are burning yet that's kind of in this area right here it just seem to be the athletic fields but it's very close and if the Embers have already spread to the football field that is probably less than a/4 mile from the ocean so if I pan this way the ocean is just maybe half mile down this way so there's houses just on that side it's a uh mobile home States Park just on the other side actually of these Flames here so the fire is definitely heading that way and I just hope they have the resources to uh to protect those homes just on the side of on the side of those trees yeah I mean the best case scenario for the school obviously the best case scenario is no flames at all but if you're just looking at the athletic fields and the classrooms themselves stay intact then you can continue going to school there you don't have to you know have everybody go somewhere else so I'm sure there's going to be an effort as we see the fire trucks there to try to protect those classrooms and and keep you know some of that school the the heart of that school intact um I I can only imagine how surreal this must be for you Sam uh being there in the middle of this we thank you for your uh experience uh and perspective and and uh and Matthew we will keep coming back to you throughout the night Ed lasos and his photographer Mike armo have also been showing us dramatic pictures tonight um we want to check in with them um for an update from their location head and we are downwind from Matthew's spot a couple of blocks really uh Mikey will give you a look well through all of the smoke and Haze you can see the Flames that is uh what Matthew was just showing us a couple blocks over on tasell but the wind blowing look at all those lit Embers blowing down this way from right to left on your screen and down here is Antioch just south of haford that looks like a war zone home after home and as you see the homes on the right the Flames the wind pushing over to the left side of the road and homes on that side are now burning several homes I would think more than half a dozen in that area since we've been here the last hour or so there's also been several spot fires up here this is gillson we talk about how close we are in the village itself of the Palisades Gilson's up there gillson it doesn't appear to be on fire but a lot of the bushes spot fires in the parking lot of Gilson's right through the village and over and over another block over on Hamford some of the lawn the front lawn of a home caught on fire lit up and then it's kind of died down a hedge we saw about an hour or so that home remember we were watching that the Hedge about 6 feet tall it burned down the home not threatened but these Embers are the big problem now blowing through here you've got that foggy smoke you can't see much just heard that right another Transformer blowing up here as a a lot of power lines some of them are coming down police are going through telling everybody to to stay away but this is uh one of the side entrances here to the parking lot at Gelson's as the wind comes again look at look at this how do you fight this you got those Embers just roaring through pushed by this wind they go down a mile or so pick up another spot fire I have no idea how firefighters could get a handle on this with these winds we're all at the the mercy of the Winds at this point gillson itself not appears to be on fire it's just the hedges around here with this Spotfire and then the other side down in Antioch several homes lost there oh right in the middle of the Palisades Village itself that was the hope as this fire started fire command was hoping that they could keep it on the North End of Sunset and unfortunately with these winds this just burnt jumped right over and the wind's pushing it here's the parking lot of Gilson's the Gilson's off to the left you can see power is on there nobody's in there but it's it's not damaged yeah not damaged by the Flames parking lot though is a lot of flames through here a lot of spot fires burning through here and here's more of those winds yeah maybe we can show at those those um grocery carts uh that we were just looking at there because about an hour ago we we showed Christy fjara was in that location and we showed all those carts moving around if you were watching us during the coverage then they were moving around in the wind and now they're all on fire uh which just kind of they're all charred and burned yeah that's sort of emblematic of of what we're looking at here all right Ed thank you so much speaking of Christy Fardo let's go back to her now um and get an update from her perspective well you you heard Ed talk about the gson we're actually just a few feet away from the gson and these two apartment buildings are directly across the street these are massive complexes and they're on fire and it is really telling uh just about how much smoke and how the wind is factoring in because there are Flames under all of this and you can't see them because the wind is whipping up all of the water we're actually getting doused as firefighters are trying to dump water on the Flames but the wind is actually blowing it in the opposite direction so not clear how much is getting on the apartment complex and certainly not as effective as it would be other under other circumstances now you can see some Flames coming out of window there on the top and we're actually on Sunset Boulevard between Tesco Canyon and Via de laas and you also heard Matt talk about P High we were actually there when the fire reached the high school and it happened so quickly because there was a big gust of wind and suddenly got very dark and there was fire all around us that's when we evacuated and sad to hear that some buildings have burned there cuz when we were there we were looked like vegetation only we had hoped that it would stay that way but again this is one apartment complex the next door one is also on fire we saw Flames coming off from the rooftop but unlike other places that we've been here today there is quite a bit of firef fighter resources they brought in tons of engines to try to put out this fire but also when we get these big gusts we start to see raining of Embers and we've seen little spot fires I showed you a spot fire earlier in the gon's parking lot and that is why these spires are so dangerous the wind just starts so many fires and firefighters can't keep up sorry we just the wind just blew a bunch of water in our Direction but you see the problem here the water's blowing towards us instead of towards the Flames so firefighters really have a fight on their hands and very very hazardous and D dangerous and not at all optimal conditions that is the latest from here let's send it back to you yeah I mean it's hard to even make out her picture you see that they got sprayed by the water wasn't it was intended to go toward the Flames of course but that's sort of exactly not sort of that's exactly the problem when it comes to night flying and the winds with the fire retardant uh that that fos cheack would just be blown away from the target it's one of the reasons why they cannot fly at night there would really be be no purpose this is our Santa Monica live camera here and those Flames have been raging on this Hillside all afternoon uh this fire broke out at 10:30 it's simply called the Palisades fire at last check it was just about 1300 Acres 10,000 homes remain threatened we don't have an exact number in terms of structure loss but we have seen at least a couple of dozen homes burned and obviously other structures whether those are commercial buildings apartment complexes uh and vehicles as well Chelsea Edwards uh continues our live team coverage right now Chelsea uh is right on PCH um and which is the bottom right picture on your screen right now uh Chelsea how have conditions changed since we last talked with you well unfortunate fortunately um reporting that more homes have gone up look at what we're experiencing right now I mean we can feel the heat from the fire it is just incredibly intense look at these supporting beams fall now we just confirmed this is called Terrace Circle these are very nice homes that are in this area we actually just had a gentleman a few minutes ago drive up in his car he looked just completely in shock he was covered in in ashes in soot and he pointed and he said that's my home and then he kept walking he didn't want to say anything after that and then he continued on down this parking lot and we haven't seen him since uh his car is still parked here though so I'm I'm hoping that he comes back but he watched this he looked at this and said this is my home um you just you think of what these people are going through as they watch these images they're watching their livelihoods you know everything that they have just going up in an instant and this just progressively is getting worse I mean this when we got here it was really the structure to the left of what's burning now that was on fire and up in the hillsides now it looks like there are multiple uh structures up in the hillsides up there that are on fire in addition to these homes here on Terrace Circle there's at least three that have burned to the ground and I mean it looks like there could be another one there a little bit further down uh it's just devastating you hear these pops as well things exploding inside you know you think of all the things you have in a house you've got gas tanks you've got you know aerosol containered hairspray things like that that that pop we're hearing that over and over and over again and again just feeling the heat from these flam and just watching these structures burn to the ground with with no support I mean we we see these fire officials who are driving up and down PCH but they've got other priorities you know they're they're trying to save lives they're at various places but we haven't seen a single you know water drop or any kind of um any kind of mitigation attempt on these homes here on terrorist Circle so these are just freely burning and you can imagine these homeowners watching this and just feeling so incredibly helpless which is the sense that I got from the gentleman who pulled up here just a few minutes ago just complete helplessness Elliot if we can look up on that Ridge something up on the top has just kind of erupted as well we're seeing some very tall Flames up on the top of that Ridge and this one just keeps getting worse okay we can actually sorry Elliot if we can come back down to this the wind you can see it almost creating these little fire tornadoes that are so powerfully pushed that they're almost they're almost horizontal um you can see it kind of pushing toward the ocean you can actually see where the wind is blowing and just Fanning these Flames just fueling them I mean it's just endless fuel for this fire again the good news though we're in this parking lot and the other side of this is just the beach there's no structures on the other side there are no homes that are threatened on the other side of this but I mean from what we can tell from where we're standing it looks like everything this part of Terrace Circle is just a total loss I mean these images are just oh these gusts of wind that one nearly knocked me over uh these gusts of wind are so powerful and they just kind of come out of nowhere I mean you're you're standing here and everything kind of seems fine and then you see it hit these flames and they just whip up and then all of a sudden it hits us and we kind of get knocked back as well they are so ferocious and Powerful we can't see anything now south of PCH South on PCH for a long time we could see some flames on the other side of PCH the fire had jumped briefly but I think it was just burning brush or grass kind of on this side of the beach we could also see other structures on fire down to the South now we don't see any of that we don't even see fire Personnel down there for a while we saw quite a convoy of um fire engines that were kind of stationing down to the South there on PCH so I I don't know where they have gone or or where they have moved on to but we could at least see their flashing lights a few minutes ago we don't see those anymore so again these homes are just a total loss and just remarkable to watch these structures these beautiful homes just burn to the ground with just no support at all I mean there's there's there's nothing you could oh see that wall just kind of collaps I mean we're just watching these things crumble and fall to the ground it's it's really remarkable to watch Alex and Marla and we just saw that vehicle it seemed like they hit a wall where they just decided to turn around and they flipped a U-turn and now they're back Southbound on PCH uh this vehicle here exiting so sorry to hear about the man who pulled in and said that's my home and literally watching his home his livelihood burn obviously he has his life but it must be just beyond words to experience what so many in the Pacific Palisades are experiencing tonight Chelsea Edwards and Elliot Mendoza we thank you for your great work out there on PCH the both of you stay safe we'll check in with you looking at the clock it is now 6 o'clock this is typically the time that Alex and I welcome you to the Fox 11 News at 6 o' instead of bringing you our typical coverage we're sticking with our wall toall coverage of the Palisades fire we give you three different live images here the big box that's from our Santa Monica camera it's turned around it's usually facing towards the pier you see the hillside with the active Flames the bottom right smaller picture that is along PCH as homes burn and then a neighborhood within the Palisades there uh upper right screen more structures burning tonight uh this is one of the most destructive fires that we have seen in multiple years um right now more than 12200 Acres burn signic ific L more than that uh 0% containment this thing is totally out of control right now uh at least 30,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders at least 10,000 homes threatened and we've seen uh probably two dozen if not more uh homes that have uh already burned uh in addition to structures uh P High part of that also burning as we speak um we want to go now to uh the phone and joining us live is Charlotte who is a Palisades resident um can you talk to us Charlotte about what your experiences has been like today what are you seeing from your perspective Charlotte are you there hi yes hi there this is marotos alongside Alex Michaelson thanks so much for joining us tonight obviously we're very sorry for whatever it is that you are dealing with we understand that you are a resident of the Palisades what is your experience been like today I am so um I live in the Palisades Highlands right where the fire originated I'm also um a student at Palisades Charter High School um so around 12:00 p.m. uh we finally realized that it was kind of time to pack up we were getting texts from people that were starting to evacuate so we basically threw everything in a bag it was just my mom and I my little brother goes to school right down the road right in on Pal's Drive where the fire was and now his school has is now missing like a playground and cafeteria and the field is scorched and basically gone but we picked him up and we tried to leave um House's Drive was a mess it was like a zoo and people literally could not get out it was at of stand still so at some point me my brother and like four of his friends just we got out grabbed our bags and basically ran off of Pal's Drive um onto Sunset um I personally was like wearing Uggs in pajamas and it was quite chaotic um so yeah we ran onto Sunset and then we just walked all the way up to our friend's house on uh Sunset farther down Sunset near Marquez uh Charter Elementary School where we thought we were going to stay but then I guess the evacuation warning spread and we've been piled um about nine people in a truck and we headed down to B Bay Club um where a lot of people that evacuated from my brother's School Calvary Christian um they were gathering there um now now looking at the news reports it looks like they've also had to evacuate B Bay Club so we basically had to evacuate three times and we are now out in Santa Monica for now do you know the status of your home Charlotte what a day you've had yeah so um for now my um family home is still standing as well as um our immediate neighborhood I do know that our my aunt and cousins they're house is my aunt's house turned down um it it started out just touching on the edge we have an actual video of their house on fire and um that was about 3 hours ago so um they now told us that it is most likely all burn to the ground they are on El medo and because the fire jumped over the canyon to El medo there were no firefighters that we know was there um or at least visible in the video we couldn't see anyone and their house is most likely gone so sorry to hear about the loss of your aunt's house uh we'll be praying that your home continues to stand and and just the thought of of the images that we've seen in the last half hour or so of of your high school Up in Flames how how are you thinking about that H it's really just shocking it's um like I honestly didn't realize that from you know like the Santa Monica Mountains it could really spread that far so it wasn't even thought in my mind that we'd lose the football field and the baseball field which are two places I've spent a lot of time as a softball player um and yeah I just didn't realize that going back to school is going to be a bit different in a couple weeks so wow all right Charlotte well we're going to uh let you go hopefully you are okay tonight um and we want to our reporter actually is on the street that you mentioned um uh with a a perspective from Charlotte Street Matthew seedorf take it away yeah we're on El media right now just what she was mentioning and um it is just horrible to see just a wall of flames um I count at least seven homes on fire on this street we have one firefighter over here trying to do the best that he can and we keep hearing these occasional pops uh from inside these homes we have more firefighters showing up right now but just an intense situation with this winds and the fire and it's just it's out of control and it's hard to put into words just what we're seeing uh but just looking down the street again one two three four five six seven homes there's another one on the other side of the road that's also on fire um and this is very close to the high school as well as more firefighters are pulling in now and uh hoping they can get this to slow down go ahead send it back to you it's uh good to see uh more of these engines pulling up uh you know la FD in terms of Staffing if you're curious there's 250 plus firefighters there uh fighting these Flames they have 46 engines three trucks five helicopters four brush patrols two water tenders six paramedic ambulances one Advanced nurse partitioner unit two bulldozers 10 Chief officers and fire investigators and safety officers on scene as these live pictures just get worse and worse and worse this entire Street seemingly on fire uh let's check in with Christy Fardo uh you have you around the corner from Palisades High and uh what what's your situation now well we're also around the corner from where we just went live where I showed you those two apartment buildings on fire and I've talked about the rain of Embers and you could see them right here and you can see what they've done they've started another Spotfire now this house is threatened and there are tons of firefighting resources just around the corner from us fighting the fire at those two apartment buildings but there are no firefighters here uh I know that they are aware that this is burning because a short while ago we saw someone checking it out and then driving over to where the the firefighters are and it appeared to be a Fire official but if we pan that way I don't know how well you can make it out because the visibility here is really really poor but something else is burning just down the street from us we could see the Flames a short while ago but there is so much smoke that you can't see very far in front of you and you see more rain of Embers and still some people just now deciding to evacuate we were surprised to see how many people had stayed put but many of them are leaving now and one man as he was driving out asked me to relay this message he said that he was on RAD cliff and that there was a giant eucalyptus tree on fire and that there were no firefighters there and he was concerned that the tree was going to catch other homes on fire and no likely that eucalyptus tree caught fire just like this vegetation you see here because an ember got into it and then it started burning and so something else is now burning behind the shrub in the walkway between this apartment building and that home and again no firefighters here at the moment you do know they are across the street or around the corner I should say and we also believe that they are aware of this but we will make sure that they know as well let's send it back to you all right chrisy Fardo thank you we've been talking about uh P High P high is is going to be closed uh tomorrow as will Canyon Elementary School Marquez Charter Elementary School Paul Rivier Charter Middle School uh Tanga Elementary Charter School um sorry Paul Rivier Charter Middle School students will relocate to University High School capena elementary charter schools will report to Woodland Hills Academy um so that's all tomorrow and I'm sure the schools have let the parents know about that as well let's check in with Ed lasos now for his Vantage Point Ed where are you we are in the village and no doubt as you've been watching our live pictures you see a lot of the lookie loose that's been amazing the last 20 minutes or so a lot of lookie loose coming in some riding their motorcycles others in their pickup trucks coming by driving looking at this block burning to the down to the ground they all have their cell phones out rather the cob scene on their part any event this is Antioch just south just below haford about a block below block south of Gilson's heart of the village this whole block has been burning the last hour hour and a half the wind started with the Flames The Embers is on the right side of your screen on the western side of the street and the winds have been blowing on your screen from right to left blowing it across to homes on the left side of Antioch and as Mike the photographer was saying with these Embers when you get a really good gust his his description was good he said it looked like a a missile flying up in the air from one of the homes that's totally engulfed in flames and flying over maybe about 200 ft into the neighborhood to the left where we have a glow in the sky so there are just so many spot fires burning here through the Palisades right now the winds kicking up sometimes you get some really strong gusts and it is a shower of those lit Embers blowing across so there's really no way no way at all that firefighters can stay ahead of this because as soon as one of these spot fires hits another one is picked up by the Flames see the vehicles here more of these looky L they just come by with their their cell phones take take pictures of this my God it's the last place I would want to be if I wasn't working to be over here in a fire zone like this where people are losing their homes in any event we also had one other lady who came by and I felt very sorry for her she was in tears because it was one of her homes down here we tried to talk to her but her Point she said was she was trying desperately to call 911 she had her cell phone too when she said look I keep calling 911 it's not picking up so I don't know what the situation is about that but she had just tremendous frustration but I told her I'm sure the fire department well aware that they've got this fire out of control burning in her neighborhood right down the street Antioch and off to the right is the glow that is where we've been seeing part of uh the Palisades High School burning right along to Mescal over there and and that fire is threatening to jump over to mol and move further to the east in our Direction because the wind is pushing it this way with the Embers when we get some good gust there you can see some of the Flames lapping over the top of that home there was a home right at the end of Antioch right at tesil at South that was also on fire again one spot fire after another and unfortunately these spot fires have homes like that right there just burning burning out of control right down to the ground all right and last go question for you we we we know when we were talking you earlier there were no firefighters anywhere near you has that changed at all or is it still just burning with nobody there well we saw one firefighter driving by in in a fire truck he came around this way over toward Antioch and over to Tes uh surveying the area but that was it just trying to get an idea of what was burning but in terms of a firefight on the ground no nothing at all no firefighters we hear sirens as they move up and down on Sunset so probably some of those homes that christe's been showing us the apartment buildings up there that have been burning but nothing down here but is really as you look down at at this uh scene horrific scene there's not really much firefighters can do here and if they try to stay ahead of these these blowing Embers that's an impossibility too but it is amazing that was what the the lady who was having a you know an emotional breakdown in a sense and I certainly can't blame her trying to get through to 911 and her point was where are the firefighters and I said at this point we're we're on our own because the firefighters are doing the best that they certainly can yes they are all right Ed we appreciate you thank you so much and your photographer of course on scene stay safe smaller picture here Santa Monica cam the flames on the hillside uh just continue to burn out of control this fire is 100% out of control last check was at 3:30 when we heard from fire officials County city and state including Governor Newsome and the complete acreage at that point was 1,262 as you can imagine that has just ballooned since then pardon me uh Eric Scott the basically the public information officer of lafd was saying that he didn't think that there was going to be an update from officials another one tonight the next one was likely not going to happen until tomorrow morning so it's best to stay with us here at Fox 11 U and online we are streaming foxla.com I'm marlas alongside Alex Michaelson You could also if you have not done so yet a great resource is the fox Local app as well which has all of the information there and you can stream us live from there this big picture here this is from Pacific Coast Highway Chelsea Edwards uh is on the ground there Chelsea are you there yes I am Mara oh it's just devastating watching this I I actually just spoke off camera with the homeowner of one of these homes it's no longer standing there's there's nothing left actually right now uh when we got here there was it was a full structure he's just absolutely an understandably distraught did you hear that explosion we we've heard a few of these one I believe was a gas line we heard a very loud whistling sound after um huge explosion just a couple of minutes ago we just heard another one but this gentleman says he's lived in this area he's lived along PCH his entire life for decades uh he's been through a lot of fires a lot of natural disasters a lot of events like this but he said he's never seen anything like this before and he says this this part at least these homes could have easily been saved he just said he was here all day with his neighbors they were watering everything down with their garden hoses trying to save these homes and they had a fire engine as the Flames were coming down through the mountain and coming toward their homes and he said they ran out of water and they took off they had to go to something else so he just sort of stood there helplessly trying to to save his home and couldn't do anything about it um he watched it go up he watched it catch he first watched his neighbor home catch on fire then he watched his home catch on fire then the their neighbors and then across the street and so on and he's just kind of standing here just in utter disbelief and he just said you know this this could have been preventable this this this shouldn't have happened this way um but he said that that's that I mean what can we do there's there's absolutely nothing left there's not even a beam left standing of what was once his home everything back up in that Hillside has burned as well we saw a lot of active Flames a few minutes ago now we're just seeing a lot of smoke a lot of black thick smoke just kind of coming down throughout the canyon just heard another explosion there and as it's nightfall now we're able to see a lot of the glow from other spot fires kind of all over these Ridge points I'm not sure how much the camera can pick up but if we look directly across PCH you can see some at the very top there uh looks like there's some wind blowing as well and some uh bigger bigger um flar s that are sort of coming out from the top of that Ridge we're seeing those all up and down PCH I mean everywhere you look you just see Flames no matter what direction you're looking in there is fire um again these homes here on Terrace Circle there's just nothing left of them it appears that every single home on there uh has been lost I this gentleman that I spoke to he also said there was a 99-year-old resident they said the the residents in that area helped get her out they brought her here to this parking lot across the street across PCH and then she was eventually taken by First Responders to see safety or or to an evacuation Center um that she couldn't evacuate on her own but again he's just sitting here watching just in utter disbelief um as you would be if if you saw this I mean when we started here you know an hour or so ago there were several structures standing here not just one but several along Terrace Circle and now I mean look at this there's there's nothing left standing it's just all gone and you can see this structure burning a little bit down to the right here um we've seen a couple of people like this appear to be um transient individuals um they've approached us a couple of times and he's approached a couple times appears to be having kind of a a mental break which also understandable um I think a lot of people coming to this particular area because there's no structures on the other side of PCH you've just got sand and water so it's relatively safe in terms of what's going on in this area and in terms of what your other options are uh because there's just nothing left to burn once this jumps PCH it has jump PCH at certain points we saw those Flames down you can see in the distance now you can't even see them anymore we could see them a while ago now you just see this thick thick smoke and again no fire Personnel either um they were staged for quite some time down at the end of that street or down a little bit South on PCH they're no longer there we can hear the sirens not sure exactly where they are but no firefighting efforts on these homes as well on terrrace circles so just so hard for these residents who called this home and who are now trying to figure out how they're going to rebuild and what they're going to do from here I mean it's just devastating to watch it really is Chelsea thank you uh look at the smaller picture there of the Santa Monica Cam and it looks like that's even grown even worse in the last couple of minutes uh and that's to be expected because the winds are picking up uh let's joining us let let's Welcome to our coverage here Rick Crawford I understand and forgive me if I'm wrong your former lafd Battalion Chief Sir that's correct yes okay uh thank you so much for taking the time out uh what do you make of the Palisades fire in all of your time with lafd have you seen anything like this so you know after having a few Decades of career with the Los Angeles Fire Department actually I have seen this a few different times in this particular area however with the winds being well with a 24-hour period of of these life-threatening and destructive winds that's actually the big concerning part here um usually you have a three- day or 4 day s in the wind vent but without the winds being so Fierce uh winds at this particular time this fire got a head start it's jumped now 1,200 acres in such a short period of time and now you have structures involved and and actually the evacuation uh piece of this incident is at the top of their every incident Commander's mind right now uh as we get people out of the way and resources in there um the main piece is going to be um save as many homes as possible um and then try and let this fire try and survive as much as we can can over the night or the fire department overnight time as the winds hopefully should subside tomorrow around noon uh that happens that puts us in a more advantageous um tactical advantage to be able to now start to get this fire under control uh so I mean it it because it just seems like these winds are just Relentless uh and and I mean it give us some perspective from a firefighter's you know mindset right now what can you even do right now so you know if I if I put you in the scene of a of of a wind driven fire is what they call this right now um and when you pull up to wind driven fire there's as you can see there's Embers and fire brands that are burning you can't have any Exposed Skin uh with with your firefighting equipment on because it will you will burn um your eyes are red your nose is running um it's hard to breathe and um the conditions that you're under uh are extreme um but one of the things is that the amount of training that these firefighters go through allow them to be able to put themselves In Harm's Way uh have a the inent commanders have a really robust structured defense plan and keep the firefighters safe they will put firefighters in harms way as you you have to when this situation happens um and so they have a very robust structured defense plan they're they know where the fire is they're going to plan ahead to what where the fire is going to go and what's in its pathway uh one tool of firefighters are using for this wind is what we call wifire it's an evacuation tool and they take into account the weather that's in the area the wind speed the relative humidity and it spits out a footprint of where this fire is going to go those incident commanders are using that footprint right now to determine what the evacuation orders are uh and then we send the sheriff's department Los Angeles Police Department to get those people out of the way what we've seen a lot of and I think we're seeing it in some of these live pictures at least the bottom right perhaps uh where our reporter is there and several homes are on fire and there's no firefighter in sight uh we understand that resources are stretched thin of of a fire of this magnitude what's your take on that so you know the Los Angeles uh Basin area is what we call a resourcer area when it comes to fire departments however when you have a fire of this magnitude um even though that the weather prediction was for these Fierce winds the amount of resources you have to put onto an incident like this um is is very critical however you still have to provide coverage to the rest of the cities and the rest of the counties that you are you know sworn to protect and so firefighters are in what they call a draw down mode right now so they're using minimum resources or what we call um degraded mode and so we're using minimum resources to respond to other emergencies and other incidents and that will free up some additional resources to come to this particular incident however right now the main piece of this is the evacuation and so you know sometimes you will make a decision that you understand there may be a loss of some homes that you just can't get firefighters in front of them in a the in and enough time to get themselves set up safely to be able to make a strong firefight so you have to have let the fire come to you uh in a vantage point where it doesn't have such a head of steam as you see can see these 100 foot flam links that are coming up these ridges and so uh the incident commanders are making some very very hard leadership decisions um to be able to decide you know they actually you know live First Property next we're also hearing and we we dealt with this a little bit in the Mountain Fire I know it's a different County that was in Ventura County in November uh but about some water shortages uh are you hearing any of that with this fire in particular well you know in this particular part of of of Los Angeles is in the northwest corner and so uh you run into you know the uh Metropolitan water district in Los Angeles County and also DWP Department of Water and Power in city of Los Angeles uh water is not the issue really here right now it's just that the winds and the fact is that you can't really have firefighting aircraft firefighting as as part of this um this is a very very hard uh type of fire to fly in so minimum aircraft um the water drops that you do make um are going to uh almost be a bit bit of a hit Miss Because by the time that that water actually starts to getar to hit the ground you will see that it's going to dissipate quickly due to these you know 60 to 70 mph winds um I can see right now that there's wind gusts at you know up to 52 mph in that particular area so water from a water dropping standpoint would be a little bit ineffective and so that is causing the firefighters to be at a big big disadvantage right now yeah and you know you mentioned 52 mile per hour wind gusts and those could get even higher as we make our way toward midnight and into the early morning hours of Wednesday uh former lafd battalion chief Rick Crawford thanks so much for hopping on the line and for your Insight tonight anytime back to Fox 11's Matthew seedorf who has seen some of the worst Devastation uh Matthew I know you've been moving around where you at now yeah we're outside pal Charter High School again kind of on the other side where the majority of the fires taking place just so we can show it to you um is my understanding this is the baseball field area there some loers kind of like a Fieldhouse and uh the school is kind of The Far Side looking out there so we're not exactly sure how far the Flames have spread to the school itself but the wind is blowing that direction and it's just hard to see beyond uh what what you're looking at right now because of all of the smoke um just dealing with all the smoke and the wind out here Sam if you want to U try to flip it back this direction just to put it in perspective we're on the other side of the street there's another home on fire above us on on this Hillside uh but there's just there's so smoked visibility uh is very low right now we have seen some firefighters trying to do the best that they can putting out fires on homes but for the most part the school uh we're not we're not seeing a lot of firefighter action where we are we obviously know that they are pretty overwhelmed right now given the situation and uh just very very scary for for folks out here uh go ahead and send it back to you I just want to clarify Matthew are these the classrooms that have now caught fire because I know earlier it was mainly the athletic fields yeah we we are still on the we we flip sides here but we're by the baseball field the locker room and I guess you could call it a Fieldhouse I know um photojournalist Sam duin went to the school what are we looking at right now Sam so we're on Sunset Boulevard at Tesco Canyon this is the baseball field area and those buildings we were showing your kind of like storage buildings I think maybe like uh Dean's office so I haven't seen the actual classrooms cat on fire but what's incredible is this across the way see these fires these are homes on I believe Radcliffe Avenue which uh the fire had to jump to MCO Canyon uh to get to these homes and it's just absolutely decimated them I mean I I never thought I would see like this yeah to to Sam's Point I mean we've we've counted I mean we've probably lost count of the structures that we've seen burning um it's unbelievable something you never expect and uh this is this is Sam's High School like so many other people watching it's it's just hard to to to see yeah you know it's it's a very special place they filmed the a lot of TV shows here Modern Family was shot here I believe the Legally Blonde movie franchise was shot here it's it's the entrance to the school is very familiar to a lot of people if you watch TV and movies a lot of history here a lot of celebrities here uh Will I Am was the celebrity that uh my generation uh knew from this school but yeah a lot of lot of history here at this uh this High School yeah a lot of background let's see if we can walk up this way and and kind of show those those buildings again um we were at the the front of the school that Sam was talking about and uh the smoke alarms were going off but we didn't see active flames on the the front end of the school but again looking out here this is the the baseball field Fieldhouse locker room sort of area and um just a wall of flames right now and you can hear the wind picking up too continues to spread uh speaking of schools I'm sorry I'm stuttering there because I've got a lot of information coming at me right now thank you for that live report from P Charter High School as the fields there continue to burn just getting word that LAUSD announcing that the schools that will be closed tomorrow include Palisades fire Canyon Charter Elementary School Marquez Charter Elementary School Palisades Charter Elementary School and Paul Rivier Charter Middle School so they will be monitoring the fire on Wednesday and then potentially shift those campuses to remote learning on Thursday a couple of points that we learned uh the acreage as you can see on your screen if you're looking at your screen has now increased it went from about, 1300 to more than 2900 Acres 2,921 Acres that is the latest acreage count from lafd still threatening 10,000 homes now we are getting word from lafd that they are so strapped for resources that they're looking for firefighters to call in to this hotline to to help in this firefight that number is on your screen it is 213 57689 62 so again lafd saying we need all firefighters on Deck so if you are in our watching us right now and you think that you and you are a firefighter and you are able to help please give this a call 23576 8962 I have to say in all the years I've been covering these fires I've never seen a call out like that before no I I I was just trying thinking the same thing I don't remember us ever doing that putting a phone number for firefighters to respond to uh which gives you a sense of the severity of this issue um if you are just joining us or maybe you're joining us from another Network that just went to National broadcast it's now 6:30 uh and we are on the air with live local coverage of the Palisades fire Alex Michaelson Mara here with you tonight throughout the night here on Fox 11 on Fox 11 plus streaming on the fox Local app uh we want to go to Haley Winslow right now who um has a representative from the fire department to give us the latest information Haley yeah I'm sure you recognize this face this is one of the public information officers for lfd firefighter David Ortiz he's been here all day obviously at the Forefront of all this um first of all you know we see the Flames behind your shoulder it's obviously a little bit frightening as this fire continues to move Southwest what's the latest and what's the plan tonight as we're feeling these winds definitely pick up well the plan tonight is to put um the various strike teams into the neighborhoods that the fire might start new fires the majority of the head or the body of the fire has burned in various directions uh we have zero containment on this fire and so we have open front all around this fire um all the communities that's Sur this fire are in in a threat all right and so because of that threat um it's difficult to pre-stage a fire engine at every single home so it's it's a guessing game for us we have strategically placed fire companies where we think that the fire might go but we're also keeping mobile and moving these resources around to engage the fire at every opportunity there's opportunities in certain areas where the fire is not being pushed by the wind because the wind is super strong right now and we can have all the water in the world and not be able to stop the forward progress of the fire um as you can see certain spot fires have started in other areas like you see behind us and once one Ember lands into that area you get a new fire start and um those can carry one mile two miles down the road it's hard to predict so uh a lot of people don't see fire around them around their home and they have false sense of security because Embers can be cast in all sorts of directions um if you are in the area where an evacuation order was given it's time to get out conditions are going to get worse winds are going to pick up it's dry it's windy um it's a perfect scenario for a fire yeah the National Weather Service still saying that this is on par to be the strongest Santa anas of the season and it's looking like you know it's expected that you guys are going to be here for several days during our news conference a little bit ago we had almost 50 m per hour gust you can definitely feel it's really picked up I know it's um it's it's definitely well you can feel it uh the difference what would you say to people I know a couple of friends of mine were trapped in there and there was a little bit of miscommunication excuse me um with trying to be first told to get out and then told not to get out and um obviously there's no signal so it really complicates things right so um a lot of the evacuations are done neighborhood by neighborhood if you hear police officers coming through your neighborhood over the PA it's time to evacuate immediately when a fire starts the first thing we tell folks is to shelter in place and wait for direction especially during the beginning of the fire because we don't know what's going to be impacted when we give an order to evacuate um we don't want to be like Chicken Little and tell people to evacuate an area and get out of an area unless it's absolutely necessary so until we know where the fire is going that's when we can give an evacuation order we have established the direction of the fire which way the fire is expected to move we have computer um that predetermines and calculates the speed and rate in which the fire is going to be moving and then we can predict what evacuation orders what zones we can evacuate but separate from that independent from that we also have uh areas that are immediately threatened we don't need the chief or the person in charge of this incident to tell us to evacuate an area that the division um that's running the fire the chief that's at that scene at that Community can take independent action and order an evacuation of a community so if you do hear those police officers over the PA telling you to evacu even if they haven't given an evacuation order um via the news or you haven't received one on your phone you need to get out a lot of the phone service is intermittent right now so you might not even receive an evacuation order one in doubt if you feel threatened get out yeah and I understand there's still definitely some people in there still tonight that are trapped um our anchor before you go I know you're in high demand our anchor Marla Tes has a question for you Mara go ahead real quick and I'll relay the information we we we just put out a number for firefighters who are watching uh to call this is per lfd lfd saying we really are strap for resources can you put out this number to get us more firefighters can you ask him about that in the reality of you know what they're up against tonight yeah good question so this was something we kind of talked about at the presser that there was something put out that there's not enough firefighters and that they need you guys need more resources now we we heard I think it was Eric Scott saying that you guys have all boots on the ground you've got more resources coming overnight you've got cow fire deployed and if need be you can get more boots on the ground aircraft in the air from other states what's the plan as these winds continue to strengthen and what's the reality of the resources that you currently have right now trying to fight this so for the time being right now as far as my understanding is is that we have adequate resources on this fire we are limited to our ability to fly because when these winds do pick up um they have to do a risk analysis whether they can fly or not at night and um water drops are ineffective when the winds pick up to a certain point so it's a risk versus gain is it worth risking the lives of those pilots and firefighters in the air to drop water that's ineffective uh versus um trying to figure that out so um our firefighters are out there they're predeployment resources from all over the state that have arrived and we have these resources in place and the question comes up is will we have enough resources should we have a second or third or fourth brush fire which is very potential right now we have low humidity we have high winds and a new fire can start anywhere in Southern California in Riverside san berino county Etc so resources are being focused here but if if our resources are stretched they can be stretched to a c certain point where we will will not have enough resources so that is that is a good point um but for now we we do have adequate resources on this we have more resources coming but we do have to rotate our people through and get them rest get them fed and then back out on the line now um I have a couple friends who are on the line right now and they're kind of on standby and they they finally were able to get out um there's a lot of people obviously still trapped and they have no idea you know even with a ring camera you have no idea what's going on with your house if there's no signal so what would be your message tonight for the people still trapped for the you know people who don't know what's going with their homes and then this is only one fire we still have two or 3 days left of these winds you know and could easily see another one of these pop up yeah so if you're in doubt your your first priority is the safety of your family and you have to make that decision whether or not should I stay um this is not your typical fire where you see homeowners with a garden hose and uh you know putting little Embers of fire and and vegetation around ornamental vegetation around their house that might catch a small fire this wind is it causes the fire to have extreme fire behavior and it's explosive once you get uh an Amber Landing into a fuel bed it's 100% receptive and it's Off to the Races so if you feel that you're in a community that is threatened by this fire immediately you're anywhere mirror around where this fire is you should be getting out if you're in that evacuation Zone that's why we made that evacuation zone for 30,000 people because all those people that are surrounding the fire we have zero control over the fire the fire can jump the line and can expand and Beyond where it has established itself thank you very much fa fed cheese be very safe out there tonight now uh I know you guys have another briefing at 8:00 in the morning I've got a friend on standby right now we've talked to earlier him and his wife and uh just want to real quickly Eric um if you could just tell me what it was like trying to get out of that fire with flames on both sides well it it moved so fast when we got the first time down to the bottom of the road uh on palace's drive we were turned around by the level of smoke and Flames Eric we're going to have to get back to you I'm sorry they we're going to have to get back to you I'm sorry we'll have much more on that coming up in just a little bit I'll send it back to you guys all right Haley thanks so much uh as live look from our Santa Monica Cam and those Flames still ferocious as ever uh let's check in with Ed lasos he is there right in the village there in the Palisades Ed yes Marlin we are right in the heart of now this evacuation Zone LAPD has come by just in the last few minutes black and white with their last speakers say You must evacuate get out now Head East on Sunset this is Red Cliff acrosses Hur with just a block below gel in the heart of the village here in the Palisades and there are the burning EMP blowing from right to left on your screen that's one of the new homes that we're losing now going right up the Flames the fire earlier hit the right side all these homes at least a half dozen homes and then with the winds blowing cross R coming how blowing all those Embers and those h on the other side now catching as well we finally saw since we've been here the last couple of hours two fire engines coming down here run around the B and one of them backed up and actually left left the location redeploying a couple blocks over the other one mov around the B because they're trying to get ahead of this fire ahead of the Embers as they are blowing AC Crossways heading down east now it's interesting because LAPD this area mostly As we've been here has been evacuated you just have a lot of looky loose coming through but LAPD com I was saying with the with that Grim warning mandatory evacuation get out now Head East on Sunset that is the way west on Sunset takes you to tsal over in that area through all the smoke is about a block or two over T mesal that is Palisades High School we've already seen that has been burning as the flames and the Embers move this way and Mikey gives you look look what's left of these homes these were homes that had been here looking probably for several decades in this beautiful area Treeline Street here in the Palisades now smoke bouldering rubble and those Embers from the Flames just picking up going over and we've got at least two homes on the far left hand side burning as the fire continues to spread to the east side and that is the big concern here but at least this area just just a block south of Gelson's itself if you're familiar with this we're right in the heart of the village it's now under that evacuation mandatory order with LAPD going Street to street block by block on their loud speakers and saying get out now and if you're leaving head east east on Sunset that is the way Mike you want to take we have a quick second and I think we're okay here let's go down and give you an idea of look how ferocious these winds are this is something also that we're watching out because LAPD has been telling about all the luil L you have a lot of down lines and you've got to make sure because they could be energized which would be very very dangerous deadly so they've been on their loudspeakers as well saying stay away but look at this Devastation down Radcliff here off haford my goodness looks like a bomb blew through here this was a beautiful three-story home couple of hours ago nothing but smoldering rubble and the Embers blowing across right to left you can feel the intense heat as you walk through here here's one home that is fully engulfed and right to the left of it Mikey you see some Flames up on the top of the roof that home we're losing that home too as the winds come through and the Embers blow through here right in the heart of this Firestorm again the winds with those Embers blowing through you can also see how the winds are picking up and here comes a fire truck right around finally coming through here we're seeing some uh firefighters moving in here probably trying to get some water on trying to control these Embers as they're blowing through cuz you have this out of control fire and the winds blowing across they'll blow across to the next block further east and you've got more spot fires and that's the big concern Mara Alex you were talking about a call for LA City Firefighters look at this Long Beach Fire Department engine 10 pulling in here to try to help out with this firefight so we've got folks from Long Beach I saw some earlier from Glendale coming in here so it's an allout firefight everybody hands on de Mutual Aid helping LA City fire and this home we are losing as these Embers blow through here this is the home right next to the one that's fully indul and here come the firefighters as they try to figure out their line of attack and in this point I don't think they're going to be able to save this home unfortunately but trying maybe to control the spread of Embers and I'm thinking doing structure protection on the home right next to it that's what he's talking about structure protection right over here to keep those Flames from jumping across this twostory home as you're right in the middle of this firefight here on RAD CLI just off havberg it looks I don't have the words bomb War Zone look at this these homes beautiful stood here for decades through this area now smoldering you got the Embers and the wind still blowing from west to east and that's the problem this home is gone started with some Shrubbery burning out front a little while ago and bang just like that it is Up in Flames and here we got the firefighters that's what they're talking about here they want to try to do some structure protection this home though has already got fire burning on the top of its roof but they're going to try to get some water on it to keep those Embers from burning to the home next to it but this is a good sign a good sign in a sense since we've been here the last couple of hours these are the first firefighters we've actually seen move in here with an engine and try to get some control on this and this is engine 10 from the city of not LA City yeah finally finally finally getting a line that's the first line and to come all the way from we've actually seen of some water going up to the top of that roof trying to get this house down trying to control those Embers through here again this is an area in the The Village the heart of the village where La BD just went by a little while ago with their black and white telling everybody it's a mandatory evacuation get out run out now and Head East on Sunset evacuate it is unsafe to be here I would think most of the folks that have already left it was that big long Jam long J Jam of traffic a couple of hours ago so most folks were already gone but as this fire Moves In This Direction with those Embers and the winds blowing very strongly from west to east from teso and Palisades High over further in this direction over to chaga that is the concern they've been trying to get a lot of the folks out seemingly they all are and now we've got some structure protection here and first line of first line on this home which is burning on the up top the rooftop you look at that the upstairs area burning because the home next to it is gone just like that these winds a big dust came through a little while ago Embers a sea of Embers hit some of the shrubs on fire and the home went up just like that and now the home next to it is burning and that is the concern see look at we talk about the Embers look at this tree see these Embers if they catch onto the tree like that tree starts burning you got more ambers fly and that's why it's just so very hard to control anything like this as this fire Roars through here with the wind propelling it to but finally some firefighters here and I mean this is just a reminder of how so often this is kind of the luck of the draw how lucky this do blue homes homeowner is that this is when the fire department finally shows up firefighters had to come all the way from Long Beach to do this uh and that home could could end up being saved by this but these homes um just because of there wasn't anybody there uh they are not our total losses so many of them on this street um hopefully that this this particular Street can start going in the other direction but it's a reminder marlot as we see if fire Crews from Long Beach uh that the winds are supposed to get worse not only in Pacific Palisades but all over Southern California and there's nothing to stop another fire like this from starting somewhere else unfortunately I have this news uh just coming across from LA County fire department and the uh Angeles National Forest they are responding to a new brush fire burning in the Eaton Canyon area above Altadena so uh at this point just started no word on acreage but again firefighters from both Ellie County Fire and Angeles National Forest responding to a new brush fire in Altadena above Altadena in the Eaton Canyon area so that's what we were just talking about with the uh gentleman from lafd saying that you know we have resources here but what happens when another fire breaks out right and uh I've been seeing some messages of people saying that they're seeing fire from Pasadena so that makes sense that that would be uh that fire and um you know we'll see about getting eyes on it it's a little bit challenging with for us because of uh to to fly the the chopper tonight not only because of the Winds but also because of some flight restrictions because of President Biden still being in Southern California um and uh so it it is it it may be challenging for us to get eyes on that but if if you're watching us and you have a video of that or are seeing that please uh send it to us via social media tag us tweet it at us all the rest of it be interesting to see what that fire is starting to look like um hopefully it's nothing close to this hopefully that fire stays out uh you know in vegetation and away from homes with so um bad about this Palisades fire is as you can see it has impacted so many structures Christy Fardo has been seeing all that up close for several hours now she joins us now go ahead I know Christy you're on I don't know if you can hear us Christy you're on I don't know if you can hear us hey uh so just literally seconds ago that we heard a very loud boom and it was a tree coming down and it hit those power lines you can see them sparking we're trying to get away from them this is a very very dangerous situation that firefighters are dealing with and there was actually an LPD Cruiser going through just as that tree came down barely missed hitting it and I want pan this way and show you we're actually at Antioch and slothmore and there are buildings here on fire and these palm trees really underscore the danger they look beautiful but when you get those rains of Ember this is what happens a lot of these trees Catch Fire very easily the wind also knocks down some of the Palm fronts and that catches fire everything or lights on fire everything beneath it in fact if we pan down you can see there are some Palm fronts on fire there on the sidewalk and still we're seeing people evacuating again the LPD just came through they were on the megaphone they were telling people to leave and we're hearing booms I don't know if you just heard that all around us it appears to be Transformers Catching Fire and blowing up and again very hazardous and dangerous situation that we are witnessing firsthand here at swore in Antioch and to give you some perspective we did not even move that far with when you came out to us live the last time we were about a block and a half away at Sunset and Via de laaz and drive a block and this is what you see so firefighters really have a monster fight on their hands right now we're not seeing any resources here but again we are seeing LAPD officers and we need to get out of here so I'm going to send it back to you okay Christine be safe that's the most important thing do your thing we'll get back to you when it is safe to do so um and and you know it's a very real threat for her for the firefighters that are out there and a reminder why the safest thing for people to do is to uh listen to the mandatory evacuation orders part of the reason that we are there is to be uh documenting uh and and do so in a safe way in and often in conjunction with the fire department we train for this sort of situation with them multiple times a year to go through this in a safe way but um this is one of the worst uh situations that we've seen in many many years here this is a live look um pardon me not a live look this is a map per Cal Fire and it gives you sort of a sense of the Palisades fire uh last check not long ago calfire updated the acreage to 2,921 acres so just under 3,000 Acres have burned uh so far and then we're just getting worried about a new fire that's broken out above Altadena we've seen some images of it this is in the Eaton Canyon area LA County Fire is on this one and National the Angeles National Forest also battling this fire we do have Gina Silva our reporter she is headed to that Altadena Area fire to bring you the latest there here's a live picture this is our Santa Monica cam those Flames very active still and they will continue to be so let's check in with our chief meteorologist Adam Krueger for the latest on those wins Adam yes we have a lot to talk about here I'm going to start though with the three main takeaways if you're just kind of like joining in late today on the coverage you know we've been on for hours and hours with what's going on but the three main takeaways is the fact that the winds are going to Peak later on tonight I'd say 900 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. tomorrow is going to be our most concerning window where the winds will be strongest and also the humidity goes down even more tomorrow a little bit drier tomorrow and also worth noting that extreme conditions like what we've been seeing in the Pacific Palisades are actually widespread and occurring over a large part of Southern California and you know not I I hope there are no more fires but I was just thinking a moment ago before we heard about the one a little north of Pasadena uh and we don't know to the extent of that one yet but I was just thinking like I'm I'm almost surprised there's not more going on and it seems there might be uh just happening right now all right so now to get a little sciencey before we dive into the specific wind forecasts and and humidity forecast I want to share with you why we expect tonight the winds to Peak a little bit so we've got a setup in the atmosphere a little bit higher up you may have heard of the jet stream so those are the fast moving winds that are a couple miles above where we live down here at the surface and right now the jet stream kind of follows this path like this and there's a little burst a strong part of the jet stream just on the North or Northwest side of this low and that's getting lined up right over our area that's adding an extra boost to the winds that's happening right around 9 to 10:00 tonight and it's within this white circle right here now as that low moves farther south notice this is noon tomorrow then that most intense part of the Winds a little higher up in the atmosphere starts going south of us but that's why through the night tonight and tomorrow morning we have that extra enhancement to the wind speeds and that's why again the the Peak is really I'd say 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. for tomorrow morning now we have the Red Flag Warning no surprise that's in effect for just about all of Southern California for Tuesday Wednesday and then Thursday a part of Los Angeles and LA county is carved out of that but all these other areas continue on Thursday in a Red Flag Warning and the national weather service has a fire weather watch in effect for these areas in Orange on Friday which means on Friday this may turn into a Red Flag Warning which gives you an idea that we're looking at a prolonged Santa Ana wind event the strongest winds though you know that will be tonight and into tomorrow morning we have the high wind warnings expiring at 600 p.m. tomorrow after that point the severity of the Winds will be backing down but still it's an offshore wind a dry wind dry conditions and Gusty all the way potentially into Friday now on to the Future gust which is the forecast wind gust and I'll remind you that gusts will be the burst of wind at times so not like sustained winds not in average wind speed but just how strong it could burst at at certain moments and as we started at 7:00 you're going to notice when I go from 700 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. a pretty drastic increase in the forecast wind speed so look at this we've got 50s and 60s on the map anywhere you see purple is 35 and above but obviously you see some numbers that are higher than that and again we mentioned this was breaking just a short time ago 5 minutes ago or so we learned of a a fire a brush fire a little bit north of Pasadena so that's another spot to watch and look what the forecast wind gusts are there at about 9:00 tonight along with the Pacific Palisades the other thing worth noting here is the wind direction we've seen the winds pretty consistently out of the North or out of the North Northeast so kind of like this direction you see the streamlines going right here we expect that wind direction to pretty much be the same throughout this event which means you know if you're watching from let's say Santa Monica I know this fire is not that far off but keep in mind the winds are not blowing this towards Santa Monica that would be a northwest wind this is more North to Northeast wind and we expect that wind direction to kind of hold uh the way it is right now all right now as we go later into the night you can see 2 o'cl in the morning again intense winds just take over a large part of the map here through the night here's 4:00 a.m. still the same story some spots might see gusts over 60 there's a lot of 60s on the map there here we going to 11:00 a.m. tomorrow still very windy but I think at this point we are just over the peak of this just over the hump and then winds will start to back off gradually still Gusty in some spots but wind start to come down as we get into late day Wednesday here's a look at 8:00 pm. so that's just after the high wind warning will expire the other thing I want to share with you the relative humidity we've seen it below 20% in some spots today look what happens as we go into tomorrow as again these winds get stronger tonight into tomorrow morning and then we have this to deal with the air gets even drier tomorrow with relative humidity below 10% so this is about as ideal of a setup you can have for wildfires to spread rapidly if one were to start and we've seen a few instances of some fires already breaking out we really just need to be very careful pay close attention to what we're telling you here I know we're going to be on air for uh several more hours I believe the plan is we going to go just through the night with all this so we'll keep you posted here on Fox 11 Mara back to you yeah all right Adam thank you very very much we want to take you now uh this is the Santa Monica gam this is the the Palisades fire but we do have a look at the new fire that popped up wow and yeah this is from our Mount Wilson camera this is above Altadena so near Pasadena as well and this is being called the close fire it's burning about 20 acres so far with the possibility of spreading to 500 acres in probably no time given the winds out there and again this is being fought by Ellie County fire department and the Angeles National Forest so two of the agencies there are the lead response agencies as it relates to what's being called the close fire again 20 acres with the potential of spreading to 500 Acres quickly okay so what maybe we can take that that picture on the top left full for a second and we can talk about what's happening here that's a timelapse video let's look at this it's a time-lapse video that shows the progress of that fire burning an Eaten Canyon so you can see the rapid growth of it obviously it's not in color but it gives you a sense of of what's happened and now we go back to that live picture from the Mount Wilson camera which is in color maybe we can take a look at that full and you get a sense of the size of this um uh it is called the close fire I mean that is that shot from Mount Wilson is one of the most picturesque on that we have in terms of our live picture Arsenal but tonight that very ominous uh fire there the good news where it is burning right now is not right where homes are but we know how quickly uh Embers can move um and so that is another scary reality and we also know that they're just so many firefighters that we have and uh if we start having fires in all different directions there just simply aren't enough people to fight them let's go back now to Pacific Palisades that's where Matthew seedorf is for us live uh with a look at his vantage point and and all around you now Matthew Flames yeah you can uh just we're surrounded by Flames we keep hearing those loud bangs like it just sounds like fir crackers just going off bang bang um right now you can see uh the homes right right near power a Charter High School uh several homes on fire if not uh destroyed already and then Sam if you want to point up to the light just so people can see the smoke just blowing just look how fast it's going I mean that's something you see I've covered hurricanes on the coast that's what you see with with hurricanes and the rain just all of that wind just blowing all the smoke it's it's pretty remarkable to see and and Sam if you want to walk with me um outside the high school we're going to look kind about towards the football field looks like there's a structure burning over there and we talked about just being surrounded by by Flames but it's just all around the the football stadium we saw the Press Box on fire and we want to see CU we've seen the other side of the high school uh we saw the other side of the high school with uh the flames on the baseball field and the Fieldhouse uh the locker rooms and this is the main entrance to the school and just see uh we did see some some fire here a little while ago and I just want to get a quick look and show you guys kind of what we're seeing at the front of the school and uh yeah you can see the Flames coming in uh from this direction getting closer to the school just definitely a scary situation I'll go ahead and send it back to you Matthew seedorf thank you very much it is now the top of the hour Alex Michaelson marlot tez for one of the most dangerous and destructive fire events in recent memory here in Southern California thank you so much for being with us as we bring you this wall to- wall coverage the two of us have been on the air since 2:30 we will not leave your side tonight we're now broadcasting live on Fox 11 and Fox 11 plus simal cast of course so thank you for being with us if you want the latest information on our app that's the fox Local app a great resource especially in a crisis like we're seeing in the Pacific Palisades let's get you the latest numbers as it relates to this fire that broke out at 10:30 this morning more than 2900 Acres 2 921 Acres burned according to calire 0% contained it is 100% out of control right now 30,000 people have been placed under mandatory evacuation orders 10,000 homes do remain threatened these images here of the cars literally stacked on top of each other nearly and and look looking like bumper cars this was a scene earlier where people abandoned their vehicles and as a result La fire came in with their bulldozers and bulldoze all their car all those cars off to the side to make access for those First Responders yeah there was apparently nowhere for the fire crws to go uh it was kind of like a domino effect and so they ended up having to move those cars away like toys um so we want to show you some time lapse video that gives you a perspective of of the rapid growth of this fire which started around 10:30 this morning and then just exploded Ed and continues uh to explode tonight uh 0% containment and it doesn't look like we're anywhere close to starting that containment process because the winds as we've been reporting are only going to get worse and this fire is burning at the same time as another fire is burning at least one more fire that one is in Altadena which can be seen from the Pasadena area um but man when when it gets dark Marlo you really see how ominous it is and this is that live picture right now um from our Mount Wilson cam looking at that fire uh in Eaton Canyon uh in the Altadena area um and uh people in that area uh San Gabriel Valley are concerned when they're looking at those images right now yeah this one here is noted as the close fire and we do have Gina Silva she's on the ground she'll be heading there to bring you a live report just as soon as she arrives we will bring that to you in the meantime let's check in with Chelsea Edward who's been reporting live for us along PCH and you've just seen homes burn to the ground yeah and unfortunately Mara we're going to add to that number so far so where we were standing where we have been standing for a while we've been watching these homes on Terrace Circle go up in Flames there's been at least five that have gone up we just watched the last one on that Terrace burn to the ground but now unfortunately we're able to see in the distance there South on PCH we've got some smoke covering it now there's another structure somewhere in the distance uh that that is burning but also across on this side on PCH we've been talking about how there are no homes on this side there are some structures though that we're able to see now that they're lit up those are we believe the public bathrooms that are uh right in that area along the beach that are currently on fire so that happened within the last 5 to 10 minutes um and that whole thing is just going up we haven't seen any firefighting efforts in that area or here at all since we've been here in this particular part of PCH which means that everything in this area is just B you know if if the Flames come to it it's burning um I've been talking to the homeowner one of the homeowners here in this mobile park he says there there may be as many as 187 uh homes in this one mobile home park but that there's several others in this area now it's we don't have a clear idea yet whether that many homes in this particular area have burned uh but that's what we're looking at I mean that's the the the reality that we're facing here these homes are very tight together uh these mobile home parks you know the the structures are very close together and once one goes up if there's no mitigation efforts you know the others go up as well so we're we're watching this burn to the ground um you know we've been able to see all these homes on Terrace Circle burn not clear how many behind it have burned but it could be a lot let's take a look again uh Elliot if we look down on PCH that that public bathroom so that's a relatively large structure and that was lit up quite a bit of a little while ago but you can see those Flames coming off of it look where the wind is pushing it so the wind is still pushing everything to the West toward the ocean for a while there it turned back on us so we were standing here and all of a sudden it shifted very quickly we were getting knocked around our our camera was getting knocked around and the smoke was just coming directly in our direction that seems to have shifted now to the opposite and I I think that kind of speaks to just how chaotic this is and that we just don't know where it's going to go and every time the wind shifts these Embers get carried to a different area can possibly light up different homes like what we're seeing right now here along PCH and then we've got more homes on fire with really not enough resources to be able to tackle and to do uh property to save these properties unfortunately so again we're seeing at least one more home in the distance but uh just with the numbers of this mobile home park if this gentleman is correct and there are 187 mobile homes back there if that whole thing is flattened uh these numbers are going to be very different from uh when we wake up tomorrow morning from what we heard at the last press conference so certainly keep an eye on that but just devastating to watch that homeowner is still here watching his neighborhood burn and he just said I I don't have anywhere to go I I I have nothing left he didn't have insurance on it um there's nothing left he can do so it's just it's devastating situation for so many people right now that is just absolutely heartbreaking um I'm sure he knows this there are the evacuation centers um he probably doesn't want to go there he probably feels you know a sense of security being close to where his home was so uh those evacuation centers are at Westwood rec center and Westwood between Wilshire and Ohio on seula and there's another one at the Dream Center um and there's various ones if you have large animals Pierce College for instance and Woodland Hills will accept large livestock uh and by the way American Red Cross is set up um in conjunction with the Westwood Rec Center evacuation and the Agora animal shelter is accepting smaller animals right now so that's a place to bring them if you uh need to do that um okay so let's bring in our chief meteorologist Adam Krueger um and uh let's talk about those winds and and when we talk about Santa Ana winds what that means right is that they're blowing towards the ocean instead of away from the ocean we much prefer away from the ocean and that's why we are literally seeing the Flames go all the way up to the Pacific Ocean yeah and you know it's it's the interaction of the wind direction and the mountains and what happens with the winds when they come over the mountains and go downhill I mean essentially that's why the geography is the way it is in Southern California why the deserts are on the other side of the mountains is usually the prevailing wind the common wind would be blowing onshore it goes over the mountains and we have super dry air up up towards the deserts but uh what form the deserts is basically happening right now around a lot of the LA area on the Ocean Side of the Mountain so again yes Santa Ana winds it's offshore and usually uh when they're very strong like this it's usually an extreme scenario not just with the wind speeds but also the very very dry air we talked earlier about how the humidity actually goes lower tomorrow than what it is right now so we've got a couple things working against us here uh I'll keep showing you this we've we've mentioned it many times here tonight but as we look at the future wind gusts which means how strong the winds could be bursting at times does it mean sustained winds doesn't mean it's an average wind speed over several minutes but just a gust a burst of wind could get up to some of the numbers you see right here and as we go from around the current time starting off at 8:00 into 10:00 you're going to see just in those couple of hours a pretty drastic change and increase in the wind speeds here and notice uh the wind direction also because yes the Santa Ana wind is offshore meaning blowing towards the ocean but we can have Santa Ana winds that sometimes come from the northwest or from the North or from the northeast or straight from the east in this situation these winds are mostly going to be from the North or from the Northeast and that's what we've been seeing on a lot of the weather instruments so far we really don't expect that wind direction to change too much so keep in mind with the Pacific pal Palisades fire the smoke and the Embers are getting blown basically towards the ocean not down towards let's say Brentwood or Santa Monica or even south of there we don't expect that wind direction to change much as we uh go through the night but the wind speed is really really high we also mentioned earlier now we're tracking another fire this is in a rural area north of Pasadena at the moment not threatening homes but you see the direction the winds are blowing it is blowing everything South so it's certainly something to keep an eye on through the night here we are 2:00 in the morning look at these numbers here I mean this is just it's widespread and it's intense this is the most extreme wind event of the season and that's saying something because we've seen already a couple of extreme wind events one in November one in December uh here we go into 4:00 in the morning it's still is just about as strong as it gets out of this whole thing here we go into 8:00 in the morning still some gusts uh over 60 and then notice how kind of late night early morning the LA area actually starts to get filled in a little bit more with some of those stronger winds as well so you take just the the fire threat out of this and it's a damaging wind event to say the least I mean they're is going to likely be some type of wind damage uh I I'm getting messages from people of like trash cans blowing around in their neighborhood and and all that is happening uh we saw the live shot earlier with Christy who uh who the um tree fell near here near her and power lines you know sparked and everything and sometimes that's how these fires start right it's the strong wind knocking down a tree on the power lines but that's another thing just to be very very cautious of as these wind speeds ramp up tonight uh if possible I mean your home is where your home is right but if possible avoid some of those larger trees we may start to see some trees come down across Southern California now here we go into midday tomorrow and this is the point where we're going to be over the hump over the peak of all this because this Peaks tonight through tomorrow morning by noon tomorrow it's still windy it's still dangerous it's still critical fire conditions but we're just past what we would call the peak of all this and then as we go a little later into the day tomorrow 6:00 p.m. is a time frame we're looking forward to because that's when the high wind warning will end and you see what happens here wind speeds are backing down but another thing worth noting I'm just going to come over here and switch to a different graphic is that we've got several days of concerning Santa Ana wind conditions so as we switch to the advisories and the warnings right now red flag warnings that's in this magenta color coat just about all the area and that's for Tuesday today and for Wednesday but as we go a little farther ahead into Thursday notice part of Los Angeles is carved out of that and a little bit along the coast for Orange County as well but still Thursday all these areas are under a Red Flag Warning and now the National Weather Service for Friday has also added these areas in Orange in a fire weather watch which means these locations could switch over to a Red Flag Warning on Friday we don't expect the winds to be as strong as what we're dealing with right now but still an offshore Santa and wind will be uh an issue at that time uh and then I just want to highight as we're going through the warnings here highlight one more thing here's the high wind warning pretty much the entire area it's that yellow color for the extreme winds that's in effect like we said until 6 p.m. on Wednesday and like I mentioned earlier the air actually does get a little drier tomorrow as well very concerning fire weather setup and like I said it's not just the fire risk but strong winds I mean this is a damaging wind event there's going to be wind damage kind of scattered all across Southern California that we'll we'll get a good sense of by the end of all this I think we'll head back to you Adam Krueger thank you so so much uh we want to put up uh this information on the screen right now give you a sense of uh where the evacuations uh areas are um so this is a map from calire that shows where the Palisades fire is uh it gets you in in perspective a lot of people know Riviera Country Club not too far away Will Roger State Beach is where they have been staging the emergency crews that's where they did the press conference earlier they thought that was far enough away to be in the safe Zone um but this whole area to panga Beach uh near PCH and because of those winds that Adam was talking about we have seen a lot of this fire move from that top of that Hill moving down towards Pacific Coast Highway towards the ocean obviously nowhere to burn once you hit the ocean um the Brentwood area Brentwood Country Club Brentwood Country Mart all the rest of that so far seems to be okay uh a lot of smoke um scary to see the fire that closely but Adam has talked about not a lot of risk of the fire moving into that direction although with Embers you never quite know we we do have it can we bring up the uh Mount Wilson camera uh I know our focus of course is on the Palisades fire but we're getting some new information which is pretty alarming about the other fire this is it uh this is per the Angeles National Forest now they've renamed it we we were told it was the close fire now according to Angeles National Forest it's the eaten fire in Altadena it's grown to 200 plus acres and evacuations are underway so there are homes in direct line to now what's being called the eaten fire again in Altadena so 200 plus acres uh un united states uh the the for service Pasadena LA County Fire they are all responding as well so now we have two active fires that are threatening homes uh we hate to have to report that we do have Gina Silva she is headed to this fire again in Altadena known as the eaten fire and then we do have people who work at the Mount Wilson area and I'm being told from a colleague that those employees of ours are now being told to evacuate wow as well at top Mount Wilson the Mount Wilson which is uh responsible there so much communication not only for our station but for for many different assets um potentially could be in danger okay um we want to show you something from uh a few hours [Music] ago a sense of what some of our reporters have been up against this is a report uh from our uh reporter Matthew seedorf and photographer Sam Dubin in the Pacific Palisades area as the Flames really got going take a look you see uh we can walk across the street this is towards the football stadium I believe that is the score box on fire as we're going to turn this way with all these these Embers flying um I do have an anomer with me it's measuring measuring winds gting to 35 40 mph um with flames on the other side of the street as well see if we can PST this way um and I'm actually with photojournalist Sam Dubin you went to this High School Sam if you don't mind what's this like all it's heartbreaking this is my El motor uh the baseball Field's totally gone some of the buildings are gone this uh house across the Street's gone uh this is the newer Aquatic Center the uh Maggie Gilbert Aquatic Center looks okay right now the classrooms appear okay but it's just heartbreaking for everyone who went to this school a lot of uh a lot of people have gone here over the years yeah I can't imagine um just seeing buildings have burned down um in just this thick black smoke again winds it just stings cuz of all this debris flying around um looking at myometer g 25 M hour right now but we've seen probably close to 40 um just uh it's hard to put this into words seeing this home up here on fire and all these other structures and even a high school I'll go ahead and send it back to you all right uh that was such a precarious danger danger situation and so sad to see all of those who even a high school go ahead and send it back to you all right uh that was such a precarious danger danger situation and so sad to see all of those who uh have gone to that high school and let's hope that the classrooms are still standing uh it was the athletic fields that took the brunt we now want to show you what has uh really captivated us today and that is this scene this is when people literally abandoned their vehicles trying to escape the flames and as a results LA count or La fire came in with their bulldozers because they couldn't get through and they literally bulldozed all of these vehicles off to the side to make way for the route to allow those First Responders to get through uh let's go ahead and listen to some of the sound that we got surrounding this scene the questions about Abandoned cars that that's a good question that has come up uh law enforcement assists us heavily with evacuation but please remember it's an active incident we don't have the answers to all the these questions we will certainly look at that that's very important I don't know if police felt like they wanted to uh make a mention to evacuations okay yeah just on on that question of evacuations Vehicles left in the roadway uh if you have to leave a vehicle in the roadway get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles can't get by the gist of moving them with uh bulldozers was an emergency situation you got to get those fire resources through and they do what they have to do to be able to facilitate that so we're asking really for the cooperation and think a couple of steps ahead it's it's not just your vehicle there but then others line up behind you as well as they see what you're doing and so uh I can't stress enough please follow the evacuation orders do your best to be able to get out to safety uh bring the equipment you you will need for the next couple of days with you because as you've heard over and over again this is not going to end very quickly no it's not uh as we expect the winds if you can believe it to get even worse later tonight and into early tomorrow as well and we heard from a woman who uh was in that abandonment in that her and her husband were in separate vehicles CU a lot of people have asked us on social why did they abandon their cars and she laid it out plainly and said that all of the traffic was trying to get through and the Flames were really close and it was gridlock at so which point it was you know life over your car and so they left their vehicles there and they've just stacked up obviously it's like dominoes so that's that gives you a better idea of what really happened that becomes a a story of sort of crowd Dynamics and MOB mentality as well Ed lasos uh has had these remarkable pictures and Ed good to see a firefighter there is this the same Long Beach Crew that we saw earlier yeah you're right about that it's engine 10 City of Long Beach they moved in the first fire engines we've seen on this entire area this entire block of Antioch and haford they've been busy getting a couple of Hose lines on these two homes up here on the uh east side of Antioch and Radford as the the winds have been blowing the Embers the the West Side look at that on the other side of the fire truck they're all gone those homes nothing but sming smoldering chimy on the chimney on the other side and it's been the Ember is being pushed by these winds that have been blowing over here lighting these homes on fire and in the back they're trying to shut down a fire that's over here this PO remember last time we saw you about 20 minutes ago it was just moldering on the the rooftop area now look the fire has moved into the second floor first floor this home is burning and the home right next to it also that one we're looking at they've been doing structure protection on the one to the left but I was going to say the one on the right is we lost that one unfortunately about about 40 minutes ago the the Emperors came by and just lit it right up very fast and the fire here watch out we're going to get some water through here they've got blasting the hoses trying to put out some of these hot spots but this home Unfortunately they got here just as this one was smoldering we thought maybe by chance they might be able to save it unfortunately not but they're trying to damp it down but at least finally after we've been here for several hours and watch these Embers blowing and everything else and turrent of water comes if they're trying to hit these hot spots here finally we see an engine coming in and as we've been talking about it Marland Alex not from LA City LA County City of Long Beach coming in with their engine to try to help out trying to shut down this area and this is uh this has really been like one of the hot spots of many if you will no pun intended as this fire roared across jumped across Sunset and moved down here to the east of tesel losing these homes another burning Mike you'll give you a look on the other side it really started over here on the West Side these are the first homes that went and my goodness it's like a bomb hit this area here home after home right along as you head down to PCH just went up went up in a matter of seconds right before our eyes smoldering Rubble you see the Ember still blowing as the breeze blows through here and that's the continuing problem the Ember is continue to blow to the East and you have more spot fires down 100 200 300 yards away something that's almost impossible for firefighters to control there's a a chimney or what's left of that home incredible and then it's jumped across now you have these homes burning over here one that's L well there's actually two as I look around the bend two or three around the bend to the right off camera the one right in front of us and then the fire fight that they're basically trying well they're not going to be able to save the one to the left it is just fully fully engulfed in flames although they're hitting you with wat some lines now on the bottom and also up top but also trying to dampen down those Embers because they're trying to save the homes to the immediate left and also the homes on the back side to the Far East but it shows you this firefight here it's basically out of control W engine doing whatever they can God bless them but with these flames and the Embers that are blowing up in the Sky look at that if you go all the way up top Mikey the emers just blow up in the smoke and the wind that swirls around and they go up followall down down along to further east and it's it's a battle maybe a non a battle you just can't win when you have wins like this unfortunately no it is not a fair firefight by any stretch H it's just absolutely devastating okay uh thank you so much Ed and let's go to Christy vardo she has a similar scene and last time we saw you we had to let you go because of the dangerous uh power lines that were nearby yeah no unfortunately we saw a tree come down nearly missing an LPD Cruiser and then taking down a power line and it just started arcing and sparking everywhere we did have to get out of there but I want to show you we're a Shan SWA more near Elma or rather La Cruz drive and this is palat's Charter Elementary and sadly it is on fire and even around the corner there are several buildings on fire and down the street as well and there are no firefighters not a single one in sight I know that there is a lot of firefighting resources right now at Sunset and viela P excuse me it's having a little trouble talking uh cuz we were there earlier and there were two massive apartment complexes that were on fire and firefighters were trying to put it out and as they were putting that out a spot fire started at a home around the corner I did fly down firefighters let them know but they said that they were too busy evacuating those massive complexes and they just didn't have firefighters to spare to go tend to that house and we're seeing time and time again tonight where buildings are burning homes are burning in this case a school is burning and there are no firefighting resources in sight or to be spared and sadly this is what we're watching right now um one of the culprits that we're seeing over and over tonight are these palm trees Embers fly they catch the Palm FRS on fire and this is what we see immediately following that in fact if we pan upward you'll see that this palm tree is on fire so is the one right next to it and the real issue is that those Embers are now up high and if the flate or excuse me if gusts come through they blow them and start multiple spot fires and Gino if we pan around the other way we can show you that something else just caught fire down the street so terrible terrible scene to witness but sadly this is what we're seeing tonight let's send it back to you CH or christe thank you I want to give you a moment to catch your breath and sometimes it's been helpful to just listen into the picture every once in a while and get a sense of how windy it is so maybe we can listen to Gino Arias's picture to get a sense of how intense it is out there would you live by a Fe and you think of think of that school and all the memories and all the kids and everything else and and how now parents are going to have to explain to their these young kids about what happened here so sad as we're looking at Palisades charter elementary school right now now on in Flames we've also seen uh the P High also in Flames tonight let's go ahead and check in with Chelsea Edward she's a long PCH where she's seen entire mobile home parks go up in Flames Chelsea and more than that honestly doesn't feel real it feels extremely surreal being here and watching this I mean everywhere you look is on fire everything that we can see that is on the land that can burn is burning right now I mean from Up the Canyons to what you're looking at right now which is what's left the rubble that's left from this mobile home park to structures that are further down PCH we're not sure what those are to the public bathrooms on the other side of PCH so this is jumped PCH and is now on both sides even though there's not a whole lot left here to burn uh it is still burning um it's just remarkable to watch and you know we see that firefighter that fire engine heading south on PCH we've seen that over and over they're they're going going south they're they're coming north um but they've not stopped at any point to help to do any you know structural protection for any of these homes that's some of the frustration from this homeowner we've been talking to this gentleman he's standing near me um he's been here for a couple of hours now he he keeps giving he keeps coming and talking a little bit more he's warming up a little bit I think just still completely in shock from watching his home burn down but he said you know they were here they they knew that this fire was coming down the the homeowners were there they were trying to protect their home with garden hoses and there was a fire engine that was there right at the entrance and they he just said they could have done something but they ran out of water and then they left they said they'd come back and they didn't obviously those firefighters are are working on life-saving efforts I mean that's obviously their first priority as it should be property is secondary um but that's obviously hard to hear for the homeowners who are just watching everything they have and they they own go up in Flames the gentleman we've been speaking to said he ran back in when he knew that it was too late he knew that his home was on fire and it there was nothing that was going to save it he said he ran in and he grabbed a physical picture of his late mother and that's the only belonging that he took out of that home as he as he ran down the hill uh to get away from those Flames so I mean you hear stories like this and it just the impact is so great to these people I you think about the fear in the those people that were in their cars on Sunset Boulevard making that decision to run you know that's that's a true fear and we see these these scenes like this and I mean it's just hard to believe again I it just feels surreal it looks like we're on a on a movie set like this is not actually where we're standing in the Pacific Palisades right now when you look at the scenes of Destruction it'll be really interesting to see tomorrow when the sun comes up and to kind of get a sense of how widespread this damage is this gentleman says there's 187 he believes uh mobile homes that are in this park alone and this is just one of several up and down this section of PCH he says there's one to the South and one to the north as well and we believe that those structures are burned as well I mean it's hard to tell obviously right now with all the smoke in the air uh and these shifting winds and and you know no ability to get in and really see what's going on but um I think it's safe to assume that these numbers are going to Skyrocket from what was reported earlier this evening in terms of the structures that have been lost I mean we're we're seeing it with our own eyes we're watching these structures burn um just remarkable damage here in the Pacific Palisades and just so much just Devastation and and fear from these homeowners who are just watching everything that they have go up in flames and we can just hear the Roar of that wind it is something all right Chelsea thank you we want to talk now about the new fire that popped up it's being called the eaten fire here's some images this is thanks to Jonathan aosta here and this is burning in uh Altadena 200 Acres this just erupted already up to 200 acres and there are mandatory evacuation in place uh Angeles National Forest one of the agencies on scene says leave now if you are in the evacuation zone I'm going to read these out to you I do believe that we can throw them up on your screen evacuation orders underway for East of Altadena Drive kinoa Canyon Road Outpost Lane Glenn Springs coolage Miranda Roosevelt veranda and Ken Clair mandatory evacuations for all of those areas listed by Angeles National Forest that agency is saying to leave now and you can see these Flames here and how close they are to homes and this is another vantage point from above looks like from a helicopter here and uh it's burning out of control there are multiple agencies on this one Alex Pasad fire uh LA County Fire which we know is also helping in the Palisades fire Pasadena PD is out there as well and uh LASD uh as well LA County Sheriff's Department with those road closures and evacuation orders wow yeah this is our best uh video so far of that brush fire um which is burning near Pasadena uh wow look at that and uh this is the live picture that we've been looking at from Mount Wilson which we hear um is there have been some evacuations ordered there also just got word the city of Santa Monica back in our other fire uh what's happening in the Palisades has just issued a evacuation order we've been talking about that City Santa Monica seems somewhat in the clear it's where a lot of people went to evacuate but they are now um evacuating uh all areas of the city north of San vien uh immediate threat to life lawful order to leave now areas now closed to Public Access um so that is uh areas north of Montana to San ven uh so um FYI about the city of Santa Monica if you live there the message is to get out at lascos um back in the Palisades area um and uh you know and and some of the the worst images of Destruction have been from Ed and his photographer Mike armo Ed yes it's heartbreaking unbelievable looks like a nightmare I got to tell you and interesting you talked about those evacuation notices now coming up in Santa Monica something that we heard about 30 minutes ago in this neighborhood here just off sunset in pal in the Palisades LAPD going by and their Black and Whites on the loudspeakers saying get out now mandatory evacuation evacuate eastbound on Sunset which would take you back in that direction who you were just talking about where they are now asking folks to leave in that area of Santa Monica going moving toward the Brentwood area crazy scene out here Long Beach engine 10 on this scene Antioch Radford just off haford about a block South if you will towards PCH just on the back side of Gilson's give you an idea heart of the village of the Palisades this one home here is sadly the latest casualty of this out ofc control wildfire that front end looks like it's going to give away in fact some of the firefighters just pulled out as they're thinking that wall that front wall might come crashing down it's one of jeez I don't know a dozen maybe more homes on this one street alone as it winds down from Sunset down toward the Bluffs and PCH along to mesal that has been lost and as you look down the road down the street itself Antioch one after another you just see one of the homes another homes burning burning burning because of the trouble is the Embers that keep blowing from this wind as Mike Oro the photographer would saying it was almost like missiles that wind blowing through I know huh and it picks up all those Embers missiles if you will lit missiles blows them down and look at the front of that looks like it's just sadly we're lose another home here they I must tell you though the the firefighters from Long Beach have moved in first ones we've seen and they're working very hard to try to contain this one if you can and do protection structure protection on the home right next to it to the left side because the one on the right side we've already lost U so they're doing their best you can see them pouring water on the one to try to keep it cool so that these Embers and the fire does not spread they don't want it to go up this block as it's right in the direct it's down wind in the direct line of all The Embers and where the fire has been burning as it's burning now on the east side of tasell we've already lost some areas over at P high school if you're familiar with the area it jumps over to Mesa over that Canyon area over the roadway onto the East Side into the uh Antioch Street area haford right along right basically across from tasell and P High backside of Gilson's and and it's just been a firefight here the last couple of hours several of these homes gone and as you look over past that's these are the homes that we first lost here was this fire the Sparks first hit this area chimneys standing brick chimneys all that's left of just smoldering burning debris and at times you might hear some gas canisters pop that's about it and then over here down there look at the that's a look there of a lot of the fire engines that are moving in further down along to Mell as you come down closer to PCH trying to do trying to get a handle on some of the Flames that are burning down there some of the homes that are burning down there as they're trying desperately just to try to contain a lot of these burning embers as they're going through I don't know if we can look through the trees over there it's probably a tough shot but there's a huge home down there a mansion some of these homes are beautiful they're up on the hillside overlooking PCH great views down over the Bluffs that one is fully engulfed several stories high just an unbelievable scene here war zone a lady came by a little earlier saying desperately she was trying to call 911 complaining that there was no way to get through 911 that was at a point when there were no fire trucks no fire engines no firemen anywhere to be seen in this particular area in this particular neighborhood she was and there's a good look at that home I was talking about further down on Antioch here my goodness it is a firestorm here raging out of control firefighters Long Beach are here doing their best but with these winds and these Embers there's not much you can do not much anyone can do wow uh so uh depressing and sad to look at um at last ghost Mike Caro thank you for the excellent coverage uh all evening long in very very tough conditions out there um as we watch these homes continue to burn um you know we've been talking about evacuations uh we just talked about the fact that Santa Monica now adding evacuations Eaton Canyon adding evacuations Governor Newsome uh is in town tonight because he was supposed to meet with President Biden out in thermal for National Monument that had to be cancelled President Biden stuck here in Southern California tonight Governor New ended up going to the press conference uh earlier today in Santa Monica and uh he talked about the need to follow uh when it comes to those mandatory evacuations let's listen by no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods you heard a Chiefs say 10 p.m. tonight to 5:00 a.m. tomorrow will be Peak winds and having just quite literally an hour or so ago gone up the canyon and saw firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the Embers and the number of structures that are destroyed not a few many structures already destroyed and the fact that people were still not evacuated still did not heed the warning we just coming down the canyon uh is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders well he also declared a state of emergency as it relates to this and he did reach out to uh President Biden Alex may have just mentioned that and to get FEMA involved and help get more federal dollars uh let's give you a look President Biden gave the approval for that uh so Federal government's going to be spending a lot of money on helping to fight this fire okay so let's uh talk about the evacuation centers that are so precious to so many people I know a lot of people you know had fled to Santa Monica but now North of San vente all of those areas are under a mandatory evacuation uh if you need an evacuation Center the closest one to the Pacific Palisades would be the Westwood recreation center it's at 1350 South oful Boulevard this is right between Wilshire and Ohio uh this is where American Red Cross is also set up they are accepting small animals there as well another evacuation Center that we have is I know the Dream Center is another one that has opened its doors this is uh in Hollywood the 23 00 block 2301 bellw Avenue in Los Angeles and I just got a message from uh Clint Carlton who helps run the Dream Center and he says this is open not just for the Palisades fire but now the eaten fire as well so if you are in a situation where you need a place to stay tonight the Dream Center is your place to go that is a good option for you in terms of animals you can also go to the Pierce College uh in Woodland Hills that one is accepting large livestock smaller animals the LA County Animal Shelter in Agora is accepting smaller animals so those are your uh animal evacuation centers in addition to the the human evacuation centers if you will uh we continue to look at live pictures like this all afternoon and it's just getting worse and worse now that the sun has set a couple of hours ago Alex looks like you have some new information yeah the White House just put out a statement from president Biden um who is here uh in Southern California tonight um the statement not on camera saying he's being frequently briefed on the wildfires in West Los Angeles uh my team and I are in touch with state and local officials and I've offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire earlier tonight FEMA approved a fire management assistance grant to support areas that are impacted and help reimburse the state of California for the immediate firefighting cost my Administration will do everything it can to support the response I urge the residents of Pacific Palisades and surrounding areas of Los Angeles to stay vigilant and listen to local officials so that is a uh a statement from the president um we have not even though he is right down the street from where these fires are we haven't seen him um on camera I haven't seen him uh going to you know I need the briefings which would cause quite a security situation and may not be all that helpful right now considering Secret Service and all the rest of it um but if we look at this live picture once again you get a sense of just the Embers and um how scary this is and how we are not anywhere close to being out of the woods yet um Matthew seedorf uh continues his excellent reporting Matthew um is on the move and we've got some firefighters with them as well Matthew yeah you can feel that heat come behind you with that wind as the firefighters outside of Palisades Charter High School we're actually on the campus right now um we'll follow the firefighters over here as the Flames have reached campus these are actual classrooms that we're seeing on fire um just hard to imagine I mean there were there were students here in class today and now you're just looking at this and uh it's just hard to put into words you can hear the firefighters yelling for more water we saw them on the front of the school uh also with their ladder out just trying to get on top of this but just feeling the heat the Embers blowing around and this is what you're seeing all over over Pacific Palisades we were just d a little bit across town you can see just you lose track counting the number of homes that are on fire right now so this is just unbelievable um looks like the firefighters are about to get some water on it hopefully here and prevent it from spreading to the rest of the school but uh just intense situation Alex and Mara back to you yeah it is uh it is so heartbreaking and then to add to that thank you so much uh Matthew we're just getting wared that and this isn't a big surprise but it's still terrible to hear that all aircraft uh has been grounded so the firefight will not be fought from the air uh it will be fought from the ground as we have now descended into Nightfall Adam Krueger I know that's not a big surprise to you either yeah I mean we we heard about this earlier in the press conference it it would be a combination of dangerous to fly at night but also ineffective for whatever they're dropping with the winds this strong just kind of getting blown away so uh yeah not a surprise to hear that now as we go into the night here's headline number one of the three main points if you're just going to take three things away from this here it's the fact that winds will be peaking between I'd say 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m. so we're heading into that time when the winds are just going to be even stronger than what we've seen so far also the humidity drops a little bit tomorrow so it gets even drier than what we see right now and the extreme wind conditions and dry conditions red flag conditions cover a huge part of Southern California so while a lot of our coverage has rightfully been focused on the Pacific Palisades don't forget that many other parts of Southern California are finding similar weather conditions and if a fire were to start it could spread very rapidly we learned not long ago there's the eaten fire which is a little north of Pasadena something definitely to keep an eye on as we go through the night as would be any other spot is worth keeping an eye on as well all right so forecast wind gust now as we look at 8:00 tonight and head a little bit later into 10:00 so notice the extreme wind gust I mean we don't see the the computer model really for cast something like this too often it's showing widespread gusts over 50 some spots over 60 some spots over 70 mph so getting more intense with those winds as we continue through the night here's a look at 2:00 in the morning and again we're we're just like locked in to these really intense winds during the late night hours through tomorrow morning here's a look now at 4:00 in the morning things do not look any better it's it is just a wild uh map to see with these intense wind speeds being forecast here we go into 8:00 in the morning and still see the strong winds and keep in mind uh while yes the fire threat is very high there's also just the risk of straight up wind damage happening anywhere with Winds of this nature trees can come down things can get blown away if they're not secured so keep all that in mind uh through the night and into tomorrow now here's a look at noon tomorrow we still have intense winds but the numbers start to come down a little bit and then by the end of the day tomorrow at 6 p.m. that's when our high wind warning will expire and uh and then we're past the peak but still we have some uh some concern after that now another thing I want to show you here just to kind of break down why we expect the strongest winds to start picking up here tonight and when we look at the pattern in the atmosphere we've got what we call the jet stream you may have heard of this before so this is like a river of fast-moving winds much higher up in the atmosphere basically where the Jets are flying around and so the jet stream goes like this follows this kind of swirly path right here and there's a particular part of the jet stream which is just about to line up over us tonight I've got this started at 10 p.m. right on the kind of Northwest side of this intense low right here where the winds are really especially zipping quite strong and so it's those upper atmosphere winds that are adding this little extra boost to the already strong wind event we've seen all day long so that lines up right over us tonight and as we go into tomorrow morning and into about noon tomorrow then we see that batch of really strong higher atmosphere winds start to move a little farther south but between now and tomorrow morning that's when we get that little extra boost a little bit higher up in the atmosphere which is why we expect those winds to just keep increasing as we go through these next couple of hours we'll go back to you Adam thanks we'll go back now to Christy Fardo chrisy what are you seeing we're ring on Del Cru and I'm seeing a building right over there on fire and we're hearing loud boom so it appears that there's propa there and if you walk with me some people have lost their livelihoods down the street we've seen people who have lost their homes and sadly some children have also lost their school this is Palisades charter school and we've just watched as it's been decimated and there is not a firefighter around we're hearing fire alarms going off all around us but no one it can be spared to respond and when we first arrived we didn't know what this was but we saw the playground and then looked it up on Google Maps and just have watched here helplessly unable to do anything about this and just wondering about the hundreds of children who no doubt attend and looks like there's not going to be much left this is uh swore is where we're standing and you can see how much of it has been damaged or if we pan that way even destroyed and down the street in fact if we walk out this way a little bit I think if we pan down you'll see those Flames there that is a house that is on fire and now the trees all around it are on fire and the trees across the street are on fire so those homes are now in danger of burning as well and again we've no firefighting resources are here we have seen the LAPD come through they have been on their megaphones asking people to evacuate telling them they need to clear out now fortunately it looks like everyone heated those warnings and got out before we saw all of this but a very dangerous situation again we're hearing booms appears all around us appears that propane tanks are catching fire and sadly so did this school let's send it back to you yeah um we're sorry to see another school that has gone up in Flames obviously our other crew was at the Palisades Charter High School that has suffered significant damage as well Alex yeah and uh this is a live picture right now this is the Palisades that we're looking at here it's it's hard to even keep track because we've got this fire burning and we've got the fire burning in Eaton Canyon right now as well which is also threatening homes there's a live picture from Mount Wilson where you see that on the move as well and it it is I mean I I I'm sure wherever you're watching us right now you are feeling these winds as well even in this studio which is soundproof and huge where we almost never ever hear or feel winds uh we have been feeling at times this studio shaking because the winds are so intense which I've never felt in my seven years of being here um this is uh one of the most damaging wind events in modern Southern California history um we've been talking about it for days um but it's turned out to be frankly even worse than what we were predicting um and if you can believe it um the worst of the Winds have not happened yet uh that's expected to happen between 10:00 tonight and 5:00 in the morning um Ed lasos can't hear us uh but hopefully we're going to be able to tell him that he's on TV go ahead now the fire fight goes on here and it's growing more desperate by the very moment power now shut off in the last few minutes some of the apartment buildings condos all in dark we've also lost cell service AT&T one of the carriers it's out making situations even the situation even more dire this is Antioch it is just south of sunset right just south of the village of the Palisades itself right behind Gelson's if you're familiar with that just east of tesil Canyon one of the many homes on this winding block that we have lost in this Firestorm this fire engine fire engine 10 from Long Beach moving in here the first engines that we have seen first firefighters that we have seen in this area they've been doing their best to try to shut down this this fire and particularly The Embers as the winds are blowing across your screen from right to left sometimes we get those big gusts that go through here and those Embers look like like flaming missiles that fly several hundred yards toward the East causing some more spotf fires that's been the entire problem this block hit by the first wave of this Firestorm a couple of hours ago over on this block were some beautiful homes on the West Side there's a chimney a brick chimney all that's left but interesting there's that chimney that home three story home gone interesting you'd look there and it'd be a home but if you look through the smoke and the debris see it says P that's P High School T mesal Canyon in P high school and the lights that shine down on the football field normally you would never see that from this street tree line with those beautiful homes here now it's a wide open field smold in with debris of what's left of these homes as P High School itself has even been hit by this out of control fire some more booms going off some more Transformers further down on on Antioch through all the smoke is a huge mansion down there on top of the crest that overlooks the bluff looking down on PCH we're losing that one too in this firefight going up in flames it's not much that these firefighters can do they're trying with this home here to get another stream of water on it to try to shut down these Embers but at this point it's an out of control control fire and they're doing all they can but at least we are seeing our first engines first firefighters in this area they're coming from Long Beach not the city of La so you got to wonder what the heck is going on as we're right in the middle of this area we've already lost several homes and there's no listen to that here you can hear it the wind just roaring through here these winds are the biggest problem with the Embers just flying all over the place the firefight goes on still out of control but at least these firefighters from Long Beach doing all they can to try to suppress suppress these players that are blowing through here okay Ed well as a result of this uh we want to reiterate because Santa Monica is such a big area as well that uh the evacuation orders have spread to the city of Santa Monica an evacuation order for the entire area from the northern border of the city to San viente Boulevard that's between Ocean Boulevard and 26th Street an evacuation warning is in place for the area north of Montana to San viente so that is something we will continue to keep a watch on as well a live picture from our Santa Monica camera right now uh and you can just see of course the active flames and the strong winds let's get back to the ground and we are headed to Chelsea Edwards uh and she this is this is a little bit earlier uh an intense situation that she was involved in along PCH Chelsea yeah and unfortunately Mara we're going to ask to that number so far so where we were standing where we have been standing for a while we've been watching these homes on Terrace Circle go up in Flames there's been at least five that have gone up we just watched the last one on that Terrace burn to the ground but now unfortunately we're able to see in the distance there South on PCH we've got some smoke covering it now there's another structure somewhere in the distance uh that that is burning but also across on this side on PCH we've been talking about how there are no homes on this side there are some structures though that we're able to see now that they're lit up those are we believe the public bathrooms that are uh right in that area along the beach that are currently on fire so that happened within the last 5 to 10 minutes um and that whole thing is just going up we haven't seen any firefighting efforts in that area or here at all since we've been here in this particular part of PCH which means that everything in this area is just B you know if if the Flames come to it it's burning um I've been talking to the homeowner one of the homeowners here in this mobile park he says there there may be as many as 187 uh homes in this one mobile home park but that there's several others in this area now it's we don't have a clear idea yet whether that many homes in this particular area have burned uh but that's what we're looking at I mean that's the the the reality that we're facing here these homes are very tight together uh these mobile home parks you know the the structures are very close together and once one goes up if there's no mitigation efforts you know the others go up as well so we're we're watching this burn to the ground um you know we've been able to see all these homes on Terrace Circle burn not clear how many behind it have burned but it could be a lot let's take a look again uh Elliot if we look down on PCH that that public bathroom so that's a relatively large structure and that was lit up quite a bit a little while ago but you can see those Flames coming off of it look where the wind is pushing it so the wind is still pushing everything to the West toward the ocean for a while there it turned back on us so we were standing here and all of a sudden it shifted very quickly we were getting knocked around our our camera was getting knocked around and the smoke was just coming directly in our direction that seems to have shifted now to the opposite and I I think that kind of speaks to just how chaotic this is in that we just don't know where it's going to go and every time the wind shifts these Embers get carried to a different area they can possibly light up different homes like what we're seeing right now here along PCH and then we've got on fire with really not enough resources to be able to tackle it to do uh property to save these properties unfortunately so again we're seeing at least one more home in the distance but uh just with the numbers of this mobile home park if this gentleman is correct and there are 187 mobile homes back there if that whole thing is flattened uh these numbers are going to be very different from when we wake up tomorrow morning from what we heard at the last press conference so certainly keep an eye on that but just devastating to watch that homeowner is still here uh watching his neighborhood burn and he just said I I don't have anywhere to go I I I have nothing left he didn't have insurance on it um there's nothing left he can do so it's just it's a devastating situation for so many people right now this was also another scene earlier this is when a lot of people had nowhere to go they abandoned their cars because the Flames were fast approaching as a result LA City fir they had to come in because the road was completely blocked they bulldozed all the cars off to the side to make that emergency route to clear it out uh Eric Scott of lafd and LAPD Chief Jim McDonald they were asked about this situation here's what they had to say the questions about Abandoned cars that that's a good question that has come up uh law enforcement assists us heavily with evacuation but please remember it's an active incident we don't have the answers to all of these questions we will certainly look at that that's very important I don't know if police felt like they wanted to uh make a mention to evacuations okay yeah just on on that question of evacuations Vehicles left in the roadway uh if you have to leave a vehicle in the roadway get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles can't get by the gist of moving them with uh bulldozers was an emergency situation you got to get those fire resources through and they do what they have to do to be able to facilitate that so we're asking really for the cooperation and think a couple of steps ahead it's it's not just your vehicle there but then others line up behind you as well as they see what you're doing and so uh I can't stress enough please follow the evacuation orders do your best to be able to get out to safety uh bring the equipment you you will need for the next couple of days with you because as you've heard over and over again this is not going to end very quickly but this is very very very Dynamic and you can just by standing here seeing us with the wind gusts and with the predictability of this wind's going to get worse tonight so we want people to lean forward Ready set go and you ready that was Chief uh Kristen Crowley from the Los Angeles Fire Department okay so as we approach the top of the hour a programming note we've been on with fire coverage on Fox 11 since 10:30 in the morning uh at the top of the hour at 8:00 on Fox 11 we're going to go to our Fox Prime Time programming but if you want to continue watching our coverage you can flip over to Channel 13 Fox 11 plus where we're already on some of you may already be watching us on channel 13 but it's an opportunity to flip to channel 13 you can do so right now if you're streaming us we're not going anywhere we're on the fox Local app we're on the Fox 11 Los Angeles app foxla.com all of our coverage tonight is free it's commercial free we are going to be here with you and we'll be back on Fox 11 uh from 10: to 1130 at least tonight Mara yes so we have a lot of coverage headed your way because recovery not just the Palisades fire which started at 10:30 this morning but also the Eaton fire which there are now mandatory evacuations in Altadena that fire is at least 200 Acres so we are watching both fires we will also be able to bring you a live report from the eaten fire our first from Gina Silva uh just as soon as she arrives and we know that she is very close to that scene so again the Palisades fire burning out of control almost 3,000 Acres the eaten fire in Altadena 200 plus Acres at this point so e 8:00 thank you so much for watching us on Fox 11 plus also known as Channel 13 I'm marlas alongside Alex Michaelson we have live pictures across uh our area of the Palisades fire and also the eaten fire that one just popped up about an hour or so ago but right now hour focuses on the Palisades fire that is threatening some 10,000 homes still at this hour tonight it erupted earlier today Alex at 10:30 a.m. and we have special live Prime Time coverage tonight uh of one of the scariest uh fire nights that we have seen in years in Southern California let's talk about the Palisades fire first at least 2900 Acres burned that number is going to be higher than that we're at 0% containment uh 30,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders 10,000 homes threatened a lot of cars as you're looking at there were left um because people had to abandon them and then they were bulldozed out of the way by authorities that's why they are total there on the side of the street right there uh and we have seen structure after structure burn including P high and P elementary both burning tonight in uh all of this let's take a look at some of the time lapse video just to give you a better idea as we've watched this fire erupt hour after hour this afternoon those flames on the hillside this is our uh camera from West Los Angeles where Fox 11 is based looking out west and you can see just the plume of smoke which is spotted from all across Southern California and now again we have that second fire that erupted tonight so that other plume of smoke we will get to the eaten fire but our coverage does continue on the Palisades fire we want to go to Chelsea Edwards she's been along PCH and you've seen a lot of Destruction tonight a lot of Destruction uh we just saw a convoy of it looked like LAPD officers and some fire officials going this way on PCH so that may indicate that something is now happening to the north but from where we're seeing we're looking South on PCH and you know we're just seeing this kind of wall of flames uh oh this look over here Elliot to the left this is a new new flare up it looks like um you can see just in the canyon here this is just near Terrace Circle many homes several probably many in this uh mobile home Community just completely destroyed we watched as they burned one by one by one uh they went up they they smoldered for a long time then they the structure just kind of fell down crumbled on top of each other you could hear the banging and the clanging and then they were just gone now we've also been watching to the South there it's it's hard to tell exactly what we're looking at but we believe according to people that we've talked to here on the ground that that is another mobile home park called The tahan Village and that those are homes in that area that are currently burning again we we haven't confirmed that with authorities there are no authorities here to talk to but just from our Vantage Point that's what it appears that we're looking at even more homes so when we talk about this tally of the the number of homes that have been lost in this I think it's going to be a much different number than what we heard earlier um this is it's going to be much much higher just based on what we're seeing here on the ground now it also jumped PCH and we were watching this uh public bathroom burn for a while there that that burned for a very long time it looks like it is finally out now I'm not sure if that structure has has collapsed on itself yet or if the fire just has died down not sure what's happened there but yeah it is uh that is that is now burned um and this wind just continues to kick out it's really just remarkable how strong these winds are I mean there are times where my uh colleague Elliot Mendoza and I are standing here and all of a sudden we just get knocked there was at one point where he said he could actually see it he could see the smoke kind of billowing down he said it looked like a a bomb when a like a nuclear bomb goes off and you can see it coming um and then we just felt it we almost got knocked over yet again so very strong winds and they they now they're gone and now they're kicking back up again it's it's just wild they're changing directions often they're blowing toward the ocean which is certainly the best thing but other times they're headed toward the North and the South I mean it's really just chaotic oh looking over my shoulder again this so this keeps this is a new flare up not sure what's burning back there not sure what is actually back there um but something is burning now closer to this closer to the bottom here now everything on the hillside next to where we're standing has already gone when we got here a lot of that was smoldering we saw a lot of hot spots a lot of big Embers uh those have all burnt out now so this whole Hillside is gone all the vegetation is gone and back in there we believe there are homes uh and yeah I don't know what that is it's burning back there there's one of those LAPD officers I believe that's heading north so they're they're responding to something north of where we are but I don't see any Flames to the north now we did for a while there so not sure exactly where this thing is moving but a lot of Destruction in the area where we're standing near these mobile home parks um again this one it looks like there are several homes that have been lost and it appears from where we're standing that many others in the mobile home park that is closer to tascal Canyon have now burned as well so it's just been something to watch we're standing here with this homeowner who's been watching this for hours now and he just he just cannot believe the amount of Destruction that this has caused he's lived here since he's lived here his whole life and he said he's 80 he's 80 years old um he's never seen anything quite like this and he's been through a lot of natural disasters living in the Pacific Palisades and the Malibu area for 80 years so that says something about how serious the situation is it is so heartbreaking I keep saying that but just to hear his story alone is just it just breaks your heart all right Chelsea thank you so much uh Ed lasos he has more Devastation he has been in the heart of the village there in the Palisades and Ed uh what are you seeing now and we are at one of the several ground zeros of this fire fight this is rad Cliff it runs parallel to to mesal Canyon heading down to PCH the fire jumping over to mesal Canyon P High School on the other side has already been damaged and the fire roaring roaring through this neighborhood these homes on the east side you can hear the wind look at the Embers that is the biggest oh my God that's the biggest problem with this firefight these Embers just roaring through as uh Mikey Oro the photographer saying they're like lit missiles that fly up through the air unbelievable big chunks of debris burning off this one home that's going down looking all the way down this little Alleyway several homes one after the other East Ward right burnt right down caught on fire as these Embers are just spreading like crazy down further along Red Cliff around the bend more of the homes we're losing more of though fire some fire engines have moved in to try to stop the spread of those Embers down there look at this home on this side the west side of rad Cliff it has been roaring the last hour or so hearing booms coming from there the gas cylinders exploding some of the uh we also thought earlier some of the electrical Transformers lighting up and popping everywhere you look here in this area of the Palisades the Palisades Village fire fire up on the hillsides fire that's the top of the bluff some of the most beautiful spots in this area You' stand up there by those Mansions a nice park over there you look down the Bluff at PCH the ocean the bay incredible sunsets homes up there burning the hillside burning through here you would never see this this is a beautiful home a beautiful home that we lost here just brick chimneys left standing through the debris but as you look through you can see the lights from the football field of P High School you would never see that here because this home should be here but there's nothing here now over this Hillside T mesal Canyon the football field the school on the other side it's also been damaged by this fire as we swing around here's some of the homes that first went up on this area of Radcliff on the west side as the fire jumped over the canyon they're all down now smoldering debris and here we're finally seeing some fire trucks they say finally because over the last several hours nothing here L we goes front end of that home finally giving out Long Beach fire engine 10 the firefighters have been putting a lot of water on it trying to stop as they can the spread of those Embers but we knew it was just a matter of time as it was leaning and a little while ago the firefighter said get back get back it it's not safe so they moved back into more of a defensive situation now but still trying to do structure protection on the buildings next door as this home is gone flaves just roaring through the Embers fly high into the air that's the the problem and right down the alley we've lost several homes one after the other from Radcliff all the way over continuing East LAPD going by the last hour Black and Whites with their loudspeakers saying evacuate get out now no time to waste evacuate eastbound on Sunset that is the way but I must tell you it seems like everybody is long evacuated this area it's in darkness no electricity no cell service everybody just holding on and waiting for the firefighters to come through we send it back to you Ed last go uh yeah thank you so much it was quite something to see basically the facade of that house just tumble down the other side of the street you see the chimney standing which he's pointed out and just he said it war zone looks apocalyptic we've heard that word a lot today and uh it's it's gone from house to house he was talking about P High School um a little bit earlier tonight Matthew seedorf was live in front of P High School here's that report yeah you can now just we're surrounded by Flames we keep hearing those loud bangs like it just sounds like firecrackers just going off bang bang um right now you can see uh the homes right right near Palisades Charter High School U several homes on fire if not uh destroyed already and then Sam if you want to point up to the light just so people can see the smoke just blowing just look how fast it's going I mean that's something you see I've covered hurricanes on the coast that's what you see with with hurricanes and the rain just all of that wind just blowing all the smoke it's it's pretty remarkable to see and and Sam if you want to walk with me um outside the high school we're going to look kind of about towards the football field looks like there's a structure burning over there and we talked about just being surrounded by by Flames but it's just all around the the football stadium we saw the Press Box on fire and we want to see CU we've seen the other side of the high school uh we saw the other side of the high school with uh the flames on the baseball field and the Fieldhouse uh the locker rooms and this is the main entrance to the school and you see uh we did see some some fire here a little while ago and I just want to get a quick look and show you guys kind of what we're seeing at the front of the school and uh yeah you can see the Flames coming in uh from this direction getting closer to the school just definitely a scary situation I'll go ahead and send it back to you Matthew seedorf thank you uh we now move to a different part of Southern California which is also on fire this is the eaten fire in the Altadena area and for the first time our colleague Gina Silva is giving us a look from the ground those are horses Gina those are horses yes there's a woman that just came down the road here and she's trying to get her horses out of here but as you can see we are on New York Drive in elaena and this entire Hillside is on fire it has already crossed the street and there's a building ha that is in danger of also going up in Flames I don't know exactly what it is but I believe it said water water uh meters something like that but you can see this is an incredible wind driven fire the Eden fire started around 6:30 p.m. with just an estimated 20 acres and the blaze as you can see it has quickly exploded into more than 200 acres and it keeps growing there are so many homes here in danger and that is why officials have issued a mandatory evacuation order in the area that is just um west of the Eden Canyon Golf Course people living on these streets also have to evacuate immediately and I heard a lady earlier saying she didn't want to leave because she's got animals and so there was a sort of a a thing that was going back and forth but people living on these streets they have to leave immediately you can see how dangerous this situation is these are the streets Kena Canyon Road Outpost Lane Glenn Springs kulage Miranda Roosevelt vernada klair and areas east of alaa drive as you can see this is a fast moving fire and these winds are absolutely Wicked and uh I think that we are ourselves are going to have to end up moving because our vehicles are down here and this just keeps moving down now we came from Upland and I got to tell you oh my goodness the winds out there were so strong it was difficult to stand in one place so we were concerned that a fire could break out out there when this one broke out and we were sent to this location but as you can see uh Pasadena fire LA County Fire there are so many units that are here battling this Blaze as I said there are so many homes that are in danger and at this point we did hear that one home is on on fire and right over here joab you can see more people coming with their horses they're trying to rescue their animals can you imagine just oh my goodness these Embers flying everywhere hi there how many more horses do you have we have a couple we just let loose over there we're trying to get as many as we can out are any homes out there on fire aie I did not pay attention I just drove straight to the bar to get my horses out and get the rest of these guys out we're not going to let them burn I got a bunch tra and there's a bunch in there still how many more I we don't know I don't know I don't know how many how many you let out we took about four of them tra two tra another one so there should be at least maybe 12 12 about 12 are there more people out there right now I got I got okay two three what is that n are 11 12 there's 12 yeah I know they're pretty wired up they're getting used to they're getting used to it now but when the wind's blowing ERS are they don't really know what to do at first have you seen anything like this look at that Hillside yeah I've rescued before yeah yeah please be safe yeah thank you you be safe too yeah um I think think joab we're going to have to end up moving because I could see all of the firefighters that were stationed at this location and the police officers they already left and again this is New York Boulevard Altadena is up here and this is Bradley and the building that is very uh close to being on fire and then may be before the end of the night I again I don't know exactly what it is but I did see water meters what does it say here it's the pass tech center oh wow that's uh that's in danger right now okay andina tech center I know you you had heard at least one home on fire uh when you made your travels there did you actually see other homes on fire no we didn't see any homes on fire what we did see was the uh large orange glow from the 210 Freeway and that black black smoke up there on in the sky and it just was so ominous it was just you know when you look at it you're like oh no this cannot be good because it's spreading so fast these winds are just unbelievable we couldn't stand uh straight when we were in Upland and then as you're driving my recommendation is if you don't have to go anywhere don't go anywhere because driving is very dangerous right now there are there's so much debris on the freeways that's just coming at you it's just not it's horrible horrible driving conditions so we just broke into programming on Fox 11 so if you were just joining us uh Welcome to our coverage Alex Michaelson marlas Gina Silva is joining us right now from Altadena all day we've been talking about uh this fire that we have been watching in Pacific Palisades that's still burning out of control this fire now burning out of control as well in Altadena uh Gina can you talk to us about what you're seeing in terms of firefighters I was about to ask you about that a moment ago then we saw some fire firefighters get there are you seeing a lot of firefighters at work or are you seeing a lot of what we saw in Pacific Palisades which is a lot of areas that they just can't get to it's a really difficult area to get to but we did see LA County Fire I I know that Pasadena fire is also here and um Los Angeles um the the the forest fire is also uh sending out information so I'm sure they have crews out here but we haven't seen that many engines out here where we are it is possible they are in the in the neighborhoods where the homes are threatened in the Foothills again this is the Eden fire and like you know it just started at 6:30 with just about 28 you know it's just a really difficult spot a difficult situation for these firefighters who are battling this incredibly wind driven Blaze yeah it looks a lot like the Palisades fire unfortunately but uh we haven't seen the livestock like that uh here in Altadena as that was something new that we hadn't seen in the Palisades fire all right Gina we want you and joab to get to safety you said that you might have to go move so please take care of that and here's two Vantage points we have joab shot there on the ground and then from our Mount Wilson camera you see the glow of the eaten fire which started at first 10 acres then 20 acres and now it's well above 200 Acres that quickly and look as we maybe take that picture full from Mount Wilson so we allow Gina and joab to go get to safety um look how much bigger that is than it was even a half hour ago uh when we were looking at that live picture from Mount Wilson so that thing is growing exponentially uh and with winds expected to get worse in the next few hours we expect that to grow even more and let's hope that these are the only two big fires that we have in Southern California CU there is nothing stopping with the conditions we have right now from there being a third or fourth you know breaking out somewhere else let's hope that this is it in terms of fires tonight but again the worst is yet to come uh we want to go to a a report from our colleague Matthew seedorf our Matthew seedorf is back with us live um uh Matthew um where are you now and and what are you seeing in the Pacific Palisades area yeah Alex we're right off of Radcliff and this is where we've seen several homes just Up in Flames if we walk a little closer uh this home right here on the corner has actually been kind of ripping and roaring uh near Balu Street um it's just it's so devastating to see because there's I mean I would guess at least just 10 homes in this general area that are on on fire right now U just out of control we've seen firefighters they were on this street a little while ago but right now uh they're not they're just so overwhelmed with everything that's happening so it just kind of continues to grow to the next home it looks like uh there's a roof of one home that doesn't have uh visible Flames yet but it's surrounded by by fire and um that's kind of what happens right now with you can hear the wind uh still gusting Beyond 30 mph um just it's it's just devastating to see this and you feel for everyone out here we haven't seen any residents um in our area um which is a good thing because this is just a dangerous situation to be in I I'll go ahead and send it back to you I want to get a quick update from you and I know you're not right there but you you two were covering the uh Pali Charter High School fire yeah uh at last checked were the classrooms did they get in gon Flames yeah well we'll flip it around we'll show you the high school over here uh it's actually right on the other side of the street um you can see the fire trucks parked right out front right now possibly um they're they're still fighting that fire I think the majority of the school hopefully will be okay I know that they they're overwhelming it right now with firefighters uh but we did see those those trailer classrooms um destroyed and they're they're gone um and like I was saying earlier it's just it's hard to imagine that you know there were students in class here today and I know that they're they're they're wondering what's going to happen next for them in school um and just and just to clarify cuz we know that this is challenging for firefighters and they got to pick and choose their spots but some people are wondering why would you not pick the high school as one of the spots of places to defend at this point it looks like there are firefighters working hard on the high school to keep that thing under control there right yeah that's exactly right they showed up uh probably about an hour ago when we had that live shot and uh they were putting out the flames and they're still back in there I don't know if we can kind of walk a little bit closer um I do want to update it looks like the power is out for a little while we saw lights on here so that's changed we can see more firefighters coming down we got the football field to to our left here as we're continuing to walk and this is outside the high school right now uh you can see firefighters um they were walking right back into the school and attacking it so you feel like they have a pretty good pretty good hand on the the high school itself right now but I mean it's just all everything around the school is burning yeah we know the athletic fields burned earlier okay uh Matthew and Sam photographer Sam Dubin thank you so much uh joining us now on the line is Sheila kellerer she's with Ellie County fire thank you so much for being with us especially on a night like tonight uh you have Crews at both fires the Palisades fire in the eaten fire let's start with the Palisades fire what is the strategy heading into the night as the winds pick up boy good evening yes um it is it is hectic and it is is challenging for sure everybody's in position and you know like you said you're um It's a treeage situation where we're you know getting what we can get where we're at um not easy these winds are I can feel in the last hour are increasing and they've been hard and strong all day and I'm actually sitting in my uh vehicle as I'm talking to you and it's actually being fullon pushed around by the wind and and they tell us that by 10:00 to about 6:00 a.m. the peak of the Wind is actually going to kick up so that's kind of scary to to understand that so we know that there's only so many people that you have and so many places you can go um earlier with the Palisades fire some of the folks were talking about if we get another fire we might not have the resources we need to to fight fires where are we at in terms of Staffing tonight and at this point are are you basically stretched too thin um I wouldn't say we're stretched too thin because you know we have all of East County and all of our strike teams that are not up that were not up for this fire because we kind of strategically plan that you know in for this exact scenario so we can't take everything from across the county because we still have to do our day-to-day operations and that's taking care of everybody with all their emergency calls so um we do have help from our assisting agencies well we're helping LA City with this fire Cal Fire is down Governor New has sent down an extra 45 or 60 rigs so the the resources are being spread out and there is there are resources and they're doing a good job of figuring out who goes where and what happens and on a fire like the palisad if if the listeners can understand it's like a tornado coming through it's like you know a hurricane coming through it's like you can't stop the wind you can only then after it's passed through really go in and help fix things now attach fire to that it's you're not stop in the fire when it's blowing 70 M an hour you are waiting till to blow through and then you're going in and you're saving what you can save I know you're also on the eaten fire the Angeles National Forest just putting out new numbers saying that that has grown to 400 Acres uh that started not long ago at a 10 acre fire now we're up to 400 Acres uh thoughts on the eaten fire and folks there because we just saw a lot of people rescuing their horses to get away from those Flames yeah yeah it it is um the terrain is challenging just like the palisad fire with the canyons and horse horse drawn area so um they are up against what palisad folks are up against as well with the erratic winds the high winds that are into this evening so they are also going to have their hands full as um these winds continue to gust and be you know you know erratic is the best word I can use for them we've seen some streets that just don't have any firefighters on them and homes burning how do you all and I know it's very difficult uh determine where to go and where not to go which which to you know sort of let and which where to protect H how does that calculus happen so there is this um process by which there's homes it's a it's a triage sit excuse me a triage situation very much for analogy like if somebody is injured and it's obvious that they're not going to survive because they've already lost too much blood or their wounds are too great um you're not going to do anything you're going to move on to the next victim kind of like in a war triage situation homes are very similar there's homes that have got great brush protection and great structure hardening of their homes where they're very savable and you can go in and put some resources on it and get that fire out quickly and then there's homes that don't have the same type of brush clearance or the same type of home hardening or they're already burning way too much and too far gone so while that home is not going to make it anyway you're going to have to move on and you're going to save the homes just can't save any final thoughts before we let you go tonight as you know viewers are watching uh from both Altadena and the Pasadena area to Palisades and Santa Monica which we do know is now under some evacuation orders and warnings yeah I I think what's really important for the listeners to understand is that if you have evacuation warnings start getting all your stuff together the things that you would take with you make your Arrangement and if it's changes to an order you need to leave immediately don't second guess it erratic winds like this are incredibly difficult it's not your normal typ ofal you know typical fire it is Extreme and every which way so you get that warning start getting things packed up get ready to go and if it's in order get out and go because you can always uh rebuild a home but you know life is our number one priority so I need everybody really be careful in that regard and also just U think about those firefighters in first responders out there it's going to be a long night and they're working hard and I I've been up since 4 with these WIS so I know a lot of them have been in the same boat that I'm in yeah and it's uh going to be another long night at least um thank you very much for your work please pass on our thanks to the entire department as well uh we're proud of all you guys we really appreciate it um and you can only imagine um how hard it is for them uh to to be dealing with these conditions as well and doing the best that they can Chelsea Edwards she is out there uh with Elliot Mendoza behind the camera you're in P long pch in the Palisades area uh anything changed has the wind gotten even worse the I'll tell you the temperature has changed pretty significantly over the last 30 minutes or so it's dropped quite a bit uh we're definitely feeling this chill and those wind gusts seem to be getting stronger when they do happen but you know as it's been doing all day it kind of dies down for a bit and then they just swoop in and kind of knock us off our feet and then die down again so we're kind of in the middle of that but we are getting these strong gusts that are still just blowing around they're very very strong uh and again it's it's getting chilly out here definitely look at this orange glow behind us though so we're looking toward tuscal Canyon from PCH right now so we're south of Sunset and you can see just Embers now I mean the structures have now burned it looks like a lot of them are just gone there's nothing left here but these smoldering Embers hot spots that are FL bearing up here and there um but there's just there's nothing left to burn uh the public restroom across the street across PCH that appears to be gone or it's done burning at least so not sure what's left of that and then a lot of these we understand now are mobile homes these are mobile home parks there's several of them with hundreds of mobile homes in them and it looks like decent chunks of those parks are now gone um we've been showing you you know when we first got here hours ago these homes here on Terrace Circle over to the left here those were all still standing um active Flames engulfing we saw just one to the other to the other that went uh we've been talking to one homeowner who's actually still here I'm hoping that he goes to an evacuation shelter he's still here he said he grabbed a photo of his mother his late mother and he just he left but he also says he's just kind of perplexed because he says one fire engine could have saved this whole community and they were there for quite a while earlier oh let's swing over to the left here uh ell just pointed out seeing some more activity here up on this Ridge so again this is back in the hillside uh it's hard to tell what exactly is burning back there but we're seeing these big plumes of smoke come up these big flare ups and it seems like more homes are burning in the back of there as well um so again this the homeowner says that there was a a fire engine here initially they were they were dowsing the area with water then they ran out of water and said they'd come back and then they didn't so obviously had more pressing things that they felt that they needed to get to but you can imagine how devastating that is for for the people who live in these homes who just felt that they were abandoned you know um we've been talking to this gentleman for quite some time now and he now understands you know the scope of all of this he he's 80 years old he doesn't have a cell phone so he wasn't quite sure where it was happening he thought it was just contained to this one area to his mobile home park and now that he understands how big this thing is he he's more understanding of the firefighters and how they were prioritizing life as opposed to property which is obviously what they do and what we just heard from from that phone interview that you guys just did all right seeing a fire engine coming up on PCH here we've seen a lot of this they a lot of them tend to be going north when we got here a couple of hours ago the focus seemed to be on the South toward tuscal Canyon but over the last hour or so we've seen a lot of those return to the north uh and again getting these gusts of wind again that are just coming down this Hillside and you can see from the top of that Ridge see that black smoke that's now coming off the top of that Ridge so that's the way that the wind is going which is toward the ocean thank goodness um cuz there's nothing left to burn here on this side once you cross PCH other than that public bathroom which is now gone uh but you can see just how it's pushing that black smoke sideways just gives you an idea of how strong those winds are and how much is burning up there I mean again you know when it was lighter out we could see just black plumes of smoke which is usually an indicator that things inside a home are burning and that's what we're still seeing now what we're still able to see now with this orange glow all around us here on PCH that black smoke so a lot of structures have been lost no idea what the actual count is it's probably going to be some time before there is an official count certainly going to be much higher than the count that they gave us a little bit earlier today this is a rapidly changing situation going to keep evolving by the hour especially with these winds that just continue to gust and fuel these flames you know hopefully it's not pushing it into other areas that have not burned the good news is at least on this part of PCH everything is already burned there's no vegetation left to burn so just black when we got here there was spot fires and Embers that we could see everywhere there's none of that now because there's nothing left to burn so hoping that firefighters can start to get the upper hand on this but they certainly have their work cut out for them with these winds now these chilly temperatures uh it's just it's a really dangerous situation Marlin Alex is PCH open to the public no no PCH is not open to the public so PCH is closed what they were allowing for a while they were allowing people to come down down PCH who were evacuating from the highlands area and from the Pacific Palisades about 3 hours ago I want to say we had uh Black and Whites coming up and down on loudspeakers turning everybody who was trying to do that around and pushing them back up north so there is a a hard closure somewhere down there I'm not sure exactly where it is um but no PCH is not open to the public right now and we're just hearing Chelsea thank you so much for your report we're just hearing that the next press conference from lafd is not scheduled for tonight but rather tomorrow morning 8:00 a.m. at Zuma Beach so we will not get any official updates in terms of structure lost until tomorrow likely Hellfire is updating the acreage every so often and so right now we know that it's just just below 3,000 acres and it probably exceeds that because that last number given to us at least an hour ago okay uh we want to go to Christy Fardo again in the heart of the Palisades and more destruction behind you Christie sadly we're seeing quite a bit of Destruction and you mentioned that firefighters are going to give an update on structure loss until tomorrow but likely they don't even know how many structures have been lost because as we've been here we've only seen one Cal firefighter come by he asked us what this was and we said sadly in elementary school and he shook his head but we've not seen any other firefighters and we know that people have lost their livelihood there's a business around the corner that has caught fire and is pretty much destroyed and down the street people have lost their homes and now it appears that some children may have also possibly lost their school this was the backside of palat's Charter Elementary we're on swathmore we haven't been able to get to the front so hopefully the front has fared better than the back but I want to show you if we go down the street again we're on swathmore several homes have burned you can see that house right over there it has been burning for the last hour and a half or so but we've also seen glowing lights on the other side of the street which seem to indicate that something is burning over there and so often in these fires we hear people who come back and wonder why their home burned and others were spared and if we pan up I can show you one of the reasons and that is the palm trees or vegetation around it one will catch fire like this palm tree then it starts raining Embers on a home and then that house gets into the eaves and then there's really not much that can be done to save it and then there will be another palm tree right next to it that does not catch fire so it often looks in a neighborhood a little odd some homes burn others survive and unless you're here to witness it you don't really understand why but we have now gotten closer to this home you can see it is a total loss and unfortunately now we're seeing that the building right next to it is also on fire and Gino arus who is behind the camera you can pan that way over there you can see that the something is burning right down the street as well and you probably just saw that rain of Embers and that is what we've talked about and what firefighters fear because when we have these San Ana winds these strong gusts it picks up Embers when something like this house is on fire and then it starts raining all over the neighborhood and they can be carried a mile away and then they start other spot fires and again firefighters might have resources in one area not even be aware of what's burning we are going to make our way down the street so that we can see what else is on fire fortunately it looks like everyone heat of evacuation warnings we're not seeing anyone on this street anymore and you what we're witnessing really underscores why firefighters and the LAPD are so adamant that people leave leave earlier rather than later because when conditions are like this it may be too late that's why they tell people to leave when they know that a fire might head in a direction hopefully it changes Direction and The hels are spared but why take the risk is really what I've heard firefighters and police say time and time again and now that we're getting up closer you can see another home sadly has also been destroyed I don't know if these two buildings are part of the same home or if we're looking at two separate homes but it looks like there are other homes behind it on the hillside that are also burning and this car here appears maybe it was a Tesla and if we pan down there even more homes are on fire and just as we were focusing on this house a trash can a plastic trash can actually just came down the street that is how powerful these winds are I guess just blew it all the way down the street and we're going to walk down there so we can see what else is burning just so much Devastation so much so much heartbreak and unfortunately I've seen this on several streets here in the Palisades and we are as I mentioned in the heart of the Palisades where I was standing where the elementary school is there's the Frontier Communications building right there there's also a post office fortunately those were still standing it did not appear to be affected by the fire at least not yet but uh no firefighters not one in sight uh just too many fires burning at this hour for them to get to all of them so sadly this is what we're witnessing let's send it back to you it does look like a Tesla uh the frame of that house there still standing but I'm sure it won't be uh much longer until it does fall uh Christy Fardo and Gino Arius thank you for your coverage uh from CHP West Valley while we give you a live look from our Santa Monica Cam and the Flames off in the distance the following closures are in place because of the Palisades fire this's a southbound PCH at Los Flores Canyon Road Southbound toena Canyon Boulevard at mahand Drive Sheran Road at stunt road Southbound tuna Canyon Road at Saddle Peak Road and Old Tanga Canyon Road at mahand Highway that is an LASD closure uh those are the road closures in place right now because of the Palisades fire according to the CHP West Valley division a lot of road closures obviously if you don't need to be in this area uh there's no need to be and the whole idea of these evacuation orders is to get out uh before we get to our next reporter I want to make a point because I've heard from a lot of you on social who are wanting some coverage on the eaten fire we do have a crew there uh that crew just had to break down because they were getting dangerously close to some Flames so while they make their way to get to a safer location we we are covering the Palisades fire for you so don't go anywhere we will have that eaten fire coverage in just a few more moments with that said let's go to Ed lascos in the heart of palace's Village tonight with more on the Flames there Ed Flames roaring through here and so these Gusty winds we're on Radcliff it runs parallel to Mell Canyon just on the east side and Radcliff on both sides of this street as the gust come through here is well look at it for yourself one home after or another Going Up in Flames this is one of the latest ones here fire engine fire 10 from Long Beach the City of Long Beach finally coming in they've been putting some water on it trying to ease the flow of the hot searing Embers that these winds have been kicking up you can see all those Embers just lit up flying into the air and that's been causing all these spot fires this home sadly is gone and as uh Mikey sort of pans down to the right right down the street will go toward PCH and you can see home after home as you look down here on Radcliff fire everywhere you look that was a huge three-story Mansion down right at the corner there of the cliff where you make the right hand turn go to tasell and over to Pal high school that is gone looking through what used to be a two-story home here nothing but Embers but up on the hillside we talk about fire everywhere look at that roaring Flames up there on top of the hillside that's the top of the bluff by my estiga by my uh thoughts where you have great views a lot of the locals go over there there's a small park lots of nice benches great View of the Santa Monica Bay below PCH those are some incredibly wonderful homes up there and that fire looks like it's now roaring into that neighborhood up to the bluff itself and then down here just below all of that is what's left of these homes here on RAD Cliff this was the first area that was hit oh maybe about 3 hours ago as the fire jumped Sunset and just kept moving this place just some hot spots and what's left of the brick chimney really all that's standing here but as this burned the wind was blowing the flames and I should say really more importantly the the burning embers across rad blowing them in that direction and that's why it jumped across the street over here to where we have the homes burning now and it's continuing further east but I've got to tell you in the last maybe 15 minutes or so we're getting these gust of wind that come through here they continue to do that but the thing is they're now seemingly kind of blowing the Embers toward the ocean blowing them toward PCH before we saw them blowing it toward the East but see as this is gust comes through look at the Embers they're they're not blowing toward the camera they're blowing down toward PCH and that is where the firefight continues we just saw a uh a line truck from calire with maybe about a half dozen the strike team members heading heading in that direction and I assume they're probably going to try to put a fire line down there to try to deal with uh the Flames that they hit the bluff CU they don't want them to continue to go down but this area of Ratcliff just along jesal Canyon it is a total loss it is burning everything is burning here I hate to tell you several homes lost the area evacuated several hours ago no power no cell service so we're not thinking as LAPD was going door to door earlier and also with their loudspeakers on there Black and Whites telling everybody to get out mandatory evacuation the good news this sense is that they've got everybody out of here no loss of life we're praying for but now it's just a battle to keep the homes from going up some more fir trucks Mikey will give you look there's another unit pulling in here we' had the engine 10 from Long Beach here the last hour or so finally moving in this one also coming in from uh can I read also Long Beach engine 13 City of Long Beach also coming in mutual a to help in the firefight here as the firefighters trying to Stage a line in Radcliff the Ember is blowing now off of sunset blowing South toward PCH toward the bay toward the water and that seems to where this fire is marching unabated just going that way being fueled by these winds and we still get we're still getting those very strong gusting winds and unfortunately these homes well they continue to burn with the debris look at all those Embers just flying up looks like they're going to catch that tree on fire next it's it's just it's a battle where you just you don't know where if you had firefighters so I don't think they would know even where to start it is just out of control everything burning fires everywhere yeah and that's the reality I mean we heard from Ellie County Fire uh Sheila kellerer saying basically it's like trying to fight a tornado you let the tornado go through and then you deal with the aftermath after uh which is such a sad way to look at it when this is your home that is uh under uh destruction it's completely engulfed in flames that is the reality at this hour and what we think of what this aftermath will look like this neighborhood will not be anything close to the same for years uh if if ever um and you think about all the students of their schools that just got impacted in a big way I mean these stories we often talk about them when the Flames are there and everybody's attention and then the the media moves on but this will impact all these folks lives for the rest of their lives um and it's a big area of people that are being impacted by what we're seeing here um and it is a a picturesque familyfriendly beautiful affluent safe neighborhood um that people aspire to live in um and that neighbor neighborhood will never be the same after tonight um and but again we have this message this can be replaced thankfully so far we do not have any word of any injuries which is amazing considering all these images that we've been looking at throughout the night a lot of people seem to be heating the warnings but not everybody um Governor Gavin Newsome in town tonight um part of the response at the press conference earlier he talked about the need to heed the evacuation warnings we're just getting this word from LA mayor Karen bass that the city of La has to de clared a local emergency in response so we saw this earlier at the state level uh with uh Governor Newsome reaching out to President Biden and getting FEA dollars headed our way well now the city of La is doing the same thing to help clear the path for a rapid recovery as a note says here from mayor bass's office uh making it a point to say you know that the thousands of families impacted by this horrific fire the city of La is providing resources and shelter as this emergency continues she was out of the country in Ghana in Ghana on a diplomatic Mission something she was very involved with when she was in Congress working on Africa issues but uh a lot of folks wish she was here in Los Angeles tonight she's on her way back here um to try to deal with this issue so la a city declaring a state of emergency to help clear uh the money uh the path to get more money and resources to all of the impacted residents so that is good news also getting word that all Malibu schools will be closed again tomorrow due to the Palisades fire that goes without saying uh the district Santa Monica campuses are expected to be open that's interesting so the district Santa Monica campuses are expected to be open tomorrow but a final decision will be made at 6:00 a.m. Wednesday so there's a butt there as well uh and there is uh also uh the Los Angeles Zoo if you perhaps had a plan to go to the zoo tomorrow theyve put out a note that they will be closed tomorrow because of the dangerous wind and those Malibu schools were closed today Pro proactively not wanting because they were afraid of a fire breaking out in Malibu obviously that fire breaking out in Pacific Palisades just down the street from Malibu so far so good when it comes to the city of Malibu but they are worried because of the proximity of what's Happening Here in Pacific Palisades and we know Malibu has its own um you know troubled history when it comes to brush fires um let's maybe let's listen in to Governor New from a little bit earlier by no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods you heard a chief say 1 p.m. tonight till 500 a.m. tomorrow will be Peak winds and having just quite literally an hour or so ago gone up the canyon and saw firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the Embers and the number of structures that are destroyed not a few many structures already destroyed and the fact that people were still not evacuated still did not heed the warning we're just coming down the canyon uh is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders all right that was governor Gavin Nome he took part in the 330 uh that we brought live to you here with all the LA county and LA City officials uh so uh you know Point well taken if if you're under an evacuation warning get ready to get out the door if you're under an order get out and and interesting the timing of all of this part of the reason he was here was he was supposed to meet with President Biden in thermal um but President Biden who was going to Thermal to declare a National Monument landed in La last night was supposed to take off for thermal because because of all this never took off for thermal and is still here um so the president spending the night in West Los Angeles not far from all of this happening um and uh he may be watching if you're watching Mr President thanks for being with us tonight uh but uh he's here he has um already authorized emergency funds from the federal government um is in communication Governor Newsome said with him on this issue um but the president and the federal government happens to be here for this the state government happens to be here for this in addition of course to the county uh and the uh City leadership as well uh where do we want to go next I know that we're waiting for uh the eaten fire live shot uh we will get to that in a moment let's go to Chelsea Edwards back on PCH there Chelsea Mara unfortunately we're seeing yet another structure it appears this looks like a home Going Up in Flames at the top of that Ridge we can see the outline of it pretty well a minute ago but the smoke keeps shifting we can see it then we can't we can see it we can but uh that that's a new one that has not been burning as of the last hour or two so so something else is burning up there yet another home lost in this vicinity of PCH near Tesco between Tesco Canyon and Sunset Boulevard which is where we are I mean just devastating losses you're going to see when the sun comes up I think we're going to see some pretty incredible destruction in these areas um both in these mobile home parks and in the hillsides surrounding these mobile home parks near to Mescal I mean it's just everywhere we've been looking for hours now it's just been nothing but an orange glow nothing but flames and we're not too far from the Getty Villa we're told that some of the grounds of the Getty Villa burned but that the structure and the artwork has remained intact where a hoping that remains the case and that that is protected as well um you look at these homes though and just think there to be a lot of people waking up tomorrow to to to this news and just hearing about this Devastation and it's just going to be such a long road ahead for these folks uh this wind continues to blow uh it's blowing a sign that we keep hearing banging we can't see anything out in the ocean now but we can hear it banging along the the beach path I think um we also just saw a power line that went down and snapped a few minutes ago that's also new that hasn't happened yet thankfully none of the power lines that are around us here on PCH have gone down and until that one that's on the other side of PCH and we're looking at the lines around us and I I think that we're okay where we're standing here but we watch that one go down so things are just burning um you know they continue to smolder you get the fire in these palm trees and these you know power poles and they just they burn until they collapse um which is what we're seeing now they're just finally getting burnt out but you look ahead in that distance and all you see are is fire um you know you could very clearly make out structures a while ago now that's hard to even see and if structures are still standing um a lot of these there's nothing left you know when we first got here there were actual structures up on this hill next to us those aren't there anymore there's nothing there anymore the whole structures are gone W here's one of those gusts of wind we've been talking about those are so strong when they hit they just kind of come out of nowhere also seeing some emergency responders heading south on PCH they're going up and down there's a a big presence I mean we've seen them often coming up and down PCH not sure where they're headed they're they're not focusing on these mobile parks that's for sure um but they're doing the work that they need to do PCH now closed uh it's been closed for some time they were allowing evacuees to come down the hill and then leave on PCH but they stopped that a while ago and they started turning people around to go back up north on PCH so at some point here they're they're turning people around and not letting them travel on PCH because the fire is just getting so close to it as well and did jump it at one point and burn the uh the bathrooms the public bathrooms are on the other side of PCH so you can see these winds they're they're just they're swirling I mean they for a minute they go in One Direction then they kind of spin around and they blow you backwards and then they're coming from another I mean it's just wild you kind of feel like you're standing in a hurricane or a tornado or something you can't quite get your bearings at any point that temperature has also dropped quite a bit as well um for a long time we could feel the heat from the Flames from where we're standing we don't feel that anymore now it's just cold that temperature is really dropped pretty significantly and continues to drop every time uh we look around we realize it's become a little bit colder so changing conditions for these firefighters which is always tough for them of course uh they have certainly got their work cut out for them especially these winds continue which they unfortunately are expected to Alex Mara yes indeed uh Chelsea thank you so much now to Chelsea or Christy Fardo um who has been right in the middle of Pacific Palisades see some of the most destructive images uh chrisy what are we looking at now well this is Pal's Charter Elementary where we were the last time you saw me live about 15 minutes ago was down the street but it got too dangerous to be there so we had to clear out we were told that dozens and dozens of hopes were on fire and it kind of felt like a wind tunnel and so we decided it wasn't safe and as we were coming back the wind shifted again so we were able to get a closer look at Palisades Palisades Charter Elementary could see some buildings are on fire but if we pant do you know arus who's behind if you pant to the right you could see others are not on fire so we don't know at this point how much of the school has been impacted but certainly it does not look good and we want to walk down and get away from this cuz we're starting to feel the heat from these flames and you can see all around us there little patches of vegetation that are on fire and we heard firefighters say that it's like trying to stop a tornado and essentially we've witnessed that we would see wind gust come in and Amber flying all around us how can anyone stop that you really can't and that is what firefighters fear and what they are dealing with at this hour and if we pan that way I want to show you that is the FR tier Communications building again we're on Swap or I've been talking about those winds if you can the evidence of them right now we're getting pelted by the winds and you also see swirling Embers all around us but that is the latest from where we are we'll send it back to you Christy we'll allow you to get to to safety Christy Fardo uh and and tremendous work out there and tremendous work by Gino Arius the photographer you think about these photographers uh who are out there in the elements carrying the camera around sometimes walking backwards trying to stay upright in these winds with the Flames coming at them in all different directions for hours we've been on the air now for you know 12 15 hours um and just incredible work by our crews and incredible work by the firefighters out there uh as well big thanks to our crews out in the field and of course the reporters who have to talk during this these episodes with the wind gusts with the masks with the Embers hitting them the whole nine so thank you to all of our crews out there again another live look here from our Santa Monica Cam and the Flames that continue to burn out of control of this hour we keep showing you the same numbers because we haven't gotten anything new from fire officials it's just too hard and too late at night uh we we hope to hear from calire soon but at last check just under 3,000 Acres have burned we know that uh it obviously exceeds that as we're approaching the 9:00 hour uh we want to thank you for watching us we're both broadcast on Fox 11 and also Channel 13 which is Fox 11 plus uh and our coverage will continue it will we're staying here to bring you live coverage of not just the Palisades fire but also the eaten fire where Gina Silva is getting set up for a live report in just a few more minutes right uh so we are staying with you throughout the night with rare live Prime Time coverage here on Fox 11 uh we're going to be with you through at least 11:30 there is a lot more still developing on both of these fires um so as we approach the top of the hour we want to give you a a bit of a restart and show you what we are talking about here this home seems like it's being considered a lost but the fire is moving so fast and just exploding because of the wind so it's pretty intense you know all the way back there is a neighborhood minute I saw people look at us and say you kids get out of your car and walk I just got out the car we just walked only watch two houses go up the smoke is really dark and there's a lot of it listen to these evacuation orders we want people to lean forward Ready set go and be ready good evening I'm Alex Michaelson and I'm Marla Taos you are watching our wall-to-wall continuous coverage of the Palisades fire and now the eaten fire that is the latest to erupt in Altadena we want to let you know that we just heard from P Pasadena Unified School District that all Pasadena Unified Schools will be closed tomorrow Wednesday January the 8th as a result of those Flames that have now grown to about 400 Acres but these pictures here live look from our Santa Monica cam of the Palisades fire those are the Flames off in the distance the smaller picture from a ground crew along PCH was which does by the way remain closed to through traffic we are in the midst of one of the worst wind storms in modern La history and one of the most destructive fires we've seen in years and the worst is still to come uh in terms of the Palisade fire one of the two major fires we're looking at at least 20 900 Acres burned 0% containment 30,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders 10,000 homes threatened we've seen dozens of structures burn from our perspective more continue to burn we saw this scene which was a bunch of cars that were abandoned in the road fire Crews needed to get them out of the way they brought in a bulldozzer to move them out of the way they're now total on the side of the road uh in order to make way for emergency crews uh we have seen emergency crews do their best but these conditions are so bad that they can't be everywhere at every time they're basically in a Triad situation and that means letting a lot of homes burn and also we have seen fires burning at the elementary school and high school in Pacific Palisades as well let's give you a look at the time lapse of the Palisades fire it broke out at 10:30 a.m. so it's been burning for almost 12 hours now we've been on the air with continuous commercial free coverage since then and as you can see that plume of smoke just raging out of the mountains side there those Flames have not let up at all and in fact this started as just a small 10 acre 20 acre fire which is very similar to what we're seeing at the eaten fire in Altadena and then it quickly just exploded and so now again we are closer to 3,000 Acres that is the official number given about an hour and a half ago uh we hope to get new updated numbers we know that we won't hear official word from lafd and all other city and county officials until 8:00 a.m. that is the next set press conference tomorrow morning at Zuma Beach well we've got reporters that have eyes on the ground right now giving you a sense of what is happening as we speak one of those is Ed lasos and his photographer Mike armo who have uh getting blown away around a little bit right now at uh take your time uh be safe but see if you can tell us what you're seeing yeah that we're getting some of these big gust that come through here and literally you just saw they they blow you over I mean That's How Strong they are and they're blowing now in a direction where they're kind of blowing from the hillside from the mountain side down toward PCH rad cleff you're right in the heart of the village of the Palisades and this looks like a war zone here Mikey will give you a look home after home the ones right near the camera they we lost them a couple of hours ago motoring debris further down on Radcliffe as it runs parallel to T Mesa Canyon that's a a two-story home it is burning out of control on the east side of Radcliff through those trees you can see the Flames licking up through some more homes over there because initially as this fire moved through the winds were blowing from the West to the east meaning they were blowing from the right side of your screen across to the left side blowing all those Embers in this direction so the homes on this side hit first started to burn Embers across the the street that neighborhood that part of the neighborhood here on Radcliff burning still burning is even as we speak and down along there past that area as we look over toward uh that is where some fire trucks have now stationed on to mexco but look it up on the hill the Bluffs up there a mansion fully engulfed burning as some of the Embers have hit that and over to the far side right at the edge of the cliff we saw some uh fire engines some fire units moving in there a little while ago to try to maybe stop the spread of the fire if they can in the sense when you say that just basically try to stop the the flow of the Embers as they go through and Mikey over here through all of these trees fire everywhere you look that is looking up along Sunset westbound toward the highlands where the fire actually began several hours ago that Hillside is now lit up again roaring and especially it comes to light with a huge wall of flames when you have these strong gusts that come through here but it is unbelievable this area where we have lost several homes this one over here has been one that that we had some fire engines and firefighters come from the city of Long Beach about two hours ago the first that we saw in this neighborhood and they've been working doing a great job on structure protection to keep this fire we've lost this home unfortunately but they've been doing a great job to keep it from burning up the hillside up toward Radcliff up toward it we're just a block away from gillson the gillson market on Sunset if you can if you're familiar with the area so they're doing a good job with structure protection so slowly we see some more of the fire units moving in here digging in trying to stop the spread as as much as they can that is a big area down there on Red Cliff where you still have a lot of flames moving through there I'll get out of the way so Mikey can give you a look through the trees that's a home sadly it's also burning the Embers I think hit the eases of the home and then up it went unfortunately we saw a calfire strike team move in there a little while ago about a half dozen strike members with their picks and their axes going in there to try to probably dig some line but everybody all hands on deck trying to do whatever they can here the area long evacuated no power no selfservice uh we haven't seen LAPD in about the last hour we did I say that because they were going around with their Black and Whites with their loudspeakers telling everybody to get out mandatory evacuations as one of the officers said get out now don't waste time evacuate eastbound on Sunset that's been the main evacuation route so the entire area is sealed off fire engines moving in firefighters moving in but many of the hillsides here in the Palisades many of the homes beautiful homes up on the bluff burn burning as we speak no end in sight to this wild fire back to you guys that has been the scene from neighborhood to neighborhood and fortunately Ed lasos Mike armo thank you so much let's go to Chelsea Edwards and photographer Elliot Mendoza on the ground along PCH changing conditions there Chelsea just the wind continues to blow the temperature continues to drop and these homes just continue to burn I I mean we've lost count of how many we've SE seen at this point up there that that is the most active one right now that's up on the ridge that's above this mobile home park here off of Terrace Circle uh so there's some there's some it looks like there's some large homes up there and one that had somehow managed to escape or evade these Flames for this entire event have just gone up in the last hour or so so not sure what happened whether that was an ember or you know if the wind just shifted directions it just pushed the Flames toward it but that structure is now Up in Flames as well as we've just been seeing time and time again I mean from where we've been watching there have been full structures that were standing and that have there's just nothing there now I mean there's literally nothing left that homeowner we've been speaking to all night who would not go on camera I tried many times to get to talk to us he wouldn't um he's 80 years old and he said well there's just I guess there's nothing left for me to do here there's there's everything's gone um there's nothing I can do there's nothing I can do with the situation so he finally is accepting help and he's going to one of the evacuation shelters thank goodness um but you just look at this Devastation and so many people are going to be so impacted by this I mean these These are entire homes and communities in some cases at least in these mobile home communities or these mobile home parks that are just flattened they're just gone uh we don't know the extent of it yet we don't know how many of these homes have been impacted but we've seen so many and these homes especially these mobile home parks are so they're put together so tightly that you can imagine and and what we saw when we got got here and those were up in Flames is that once one goes up you just you've got that whole line of them that are likely going to go up as well especially because there's no firefighting efforts here at all I mean we've been here for hours now we have not seen any active mitigation efforts on any of the Flames that we've been seeing anywhere here on PCH but we have seen these emergency Personnel going up and down uh doing their very important work now if we look to the South you can see again just this glow this orange glow these Embers these spot fires we saw a power line go down not too long a go and you can see the outlines of some of the structures that are still there a lot of them are gone though there's there's just nothing left to burn uh so it really looks like this part of it at least you know everybody who's out is out and the damage has done in this part of this fire you know we're up against the ocean this is the direction the wind is blowing which is a good just heard a loud boom we've heard a lot of those not sure what that was um but this wind is pushing these flames and the smoke out toward the ocean there's nothing left to burn here you've got this parking lot you've got PCH and there no homes on this side of PCH so that's a good thing um I think the damage has really just been done in these communities though unfortunately that are on the other side of PCH we're just seeing utter Devastation here uh just incredible to watch I mean Ive said this before but I'll say it again I there are times where I just look up and it's so surreal I feel like we're on the on a movie set not actually standing in reality here but this is unfortunately the reality of these wind events like this I mean it there's just so there's only so much that firefighters can do there's only so many preventative measures that people can take and this is the situation that we're in um and unfortunately because this wind event is going to keep going you know it's hard to say what's going to happen overnight what's going to happen is these winds continue to kick up again right now they're they're kind of calm but then we get these we just get slammed with these huge gusts that kind of knock us around um so that's certainly happening up in the hills as well and coming down these Hills and going toward the ocean so hoping that everybody is out of their homes and just feeling for all of these people all of these homeowners who have lost everything here tonight all right Chelsea yes it is a devastating night all the way around thank you so much we want to get to our coverage of the eaten fire this is burning in Altadena this is a live look from our Mount Wilson camera there and this has exploded to at least 400 Acres we do have some really speaking of devastating devastating images of the evacuation of a senior center uh if we can bring that up to show our viewers here this is in fact a live look we have argina Silva she's there on the ground and this is our her photographer bringing these live images so it is a senior center that is being evacuated and you see all of these poor people in wheelchairs many with masks on dealing with a lot of different issues and then they have to reckon with the Wind the Flames nearby and just the uncertainty that they must be feeling how insecure they must be feeling as well uh do we have our report no but but who we do have on the line is from the City of Pasadena Lisa Dean uh thank you so much for taking the time out thank you for being with us tonight what can you tell us about the eaten fire and how it's impacting the City of Pasadena yeah you over 400 plus acres have now been impacted over a thousand homes are threatened we are currently requesting uh 50 strike teams each strike team's five engines so um numerous Personnel they could be coming from out of states to support us uh we did evacuate that um assisted living facility with the help of our Police Department um we have set up a shelter at the passina convention center and we do have mandatory evacuation we ask that people please heed to those um we're taking this very seriously especially whe we see what's been going on all day in the Palisades um when we tell you to evacuate please do so and um please be prepared for those also in the um outside just the uh jurisdictions for evacuation um all right Lisa thank you so much and we will check back in with you later tonight we want to go to the ground right now Gina is talking uh let's let's Gina I'm not sure if you can hear us I'm buddy I'm buddy so he was just telling me the gentleman was nice enough to tell us that they were rescuing 92 patients yes yes yes and um describe for us just how quickly that fire got to the facility I'm not really sure I just got here like you know 7:00 I'm a night sh yeah yeah I can't all of the patients okay yeah they PR I'll let you know thank you obviously he's very busy but just take a look I know that we saw we were at the uh nursing facility and all of the patients were being put on gurns and being transported to other locations and that's what you're seeing here 92 patients have been transported when we were there the fire was jumping the road and obviously getting way too close to that nursing facility we're not sure how if in fact it's going to survive but uh it's not looking good again this fire just with these winds you can see how strong they are and it has just been unbelievable um excuse me are you guys with the nursing facility out of the way they're it's so chaotic here you know we certainly don't want to get in the way of the firefighters and the rescue teams but there are some uh family members here also who are concerned for their loved ones you know but look they're being taken in this Pasadena SWAT vehicle uh is one of the Transporters um I believe that's the case maybe I'm wrong um but where some of the patients transported in that yeah they were okay thank you sir yeah they're using whatever they can so they were transporting some patients there you can see them inside in in the Pasadena uh swad vehicle they're using whatever they can to get these patients out of Harm's Way and you can see that uh it is just absolutely is devastating out here this fire is growing so fast uh again it started at 6:30 with just about 20 acres and it has just you know grown and grown it's more than 200 now beyond that and there are so many people that uh were obviously stranded unable to leave by themselves and you are watching these elderly folks being helped out of this location uh again we're at Washington and Boulevard in Altadena this is where they brought them from the nursing facility and uh again that nursing facility was just too close to that fire it was jumping the road and uh it's I have just received notice that it's now 400 Acres so it just keeps growing and growing and these winds are just not stopping as you can see Gina do you have any idea where they're taking these patients I am it's so hard to hear you say that one more time I'm so sorry do do you have any idea where they are transporting all of these patients I have no idea where they're transported let me ask it you know I hate to interrupt people when they're doing their job because they're trying to rescue these folks who are are you know elderly they're they're they're not in the best of shape uh healthwise you know and so I got to let them do their jobs but I'm sure they're being transported to different hospitals excuse me ma'am where are the patients being transported to uh going every they're going to many places we have transfer agreements with all the facilities so different uh hospitals or different nursing fac they're going to different some are going to the down uh to the different facility Civic Center and um and a hospital and maybe a hospital everybody's going to a different location Civic Center for sure another Skilled Nursing Facility thank you so much for letting us know so there is your answer they're going to different facilities uh but just take a look at the the atmosphere here just this wind is just unbelievable it is just Wicked and uh the smoke obviously you know very difficult uh to to breathe out here and uh where we are the fire is not that close to where we are but you can see the smoke is still trouble and also um the wind the wind is just not dying down yeah although we are seeing some Embers right there uh Gina joab showing us right now and we know how quickly those Embers can move in this sort of wind um man you think about how a fire impacts so many different people that you don't even necessarily think of those horses that Gina showed us all these people that that and and animals and all the rest of it that are impacted by this but this scene is something that I'll never forget of of all these folks um who you know need as much help as they can and the desperate effort to to help them um and and Gina to be clear the nursing home that they in I can't even open my eyes right now sorry is a ways away and was getting close the Flames were getting close to that so then they exited they evacuated them to this location yes this is the location where they brought them when I got to the nursing home there were still seniors there and they were transporting them in ambulances and different Vehicles even in police vehicles to this location then from here as you can see they're taking them in all different kinds of vehicles even the SWAT the Pasadena SWAT vehicle was transporting these Ally patients and they're going to different facilities again uh this is because of that uh that fire that is just absolutely out of control right now and uh we were told over 90 patients were transported are being transported to the different facilities but you can see here it's such a chaotic scene right now everyone else get your vehicle on the back away all PA are good everyone get out of here if you can all right at the area be careful good work guys good work all right so they're asking everybody to [Music] [Music] evacuate there's more patients down there if you guys want to record it down at the bottom just with the wood chairs they took them down where are they uh down at the bottom like about three like like two that lights down all right thank you sir oh my goodness this is just crazy it C being out here it it is crazy um Gina just in your travels did did you see any structures burning in Altadena yes we did see uh a couple of structures burning and like I said that nursing home I had to leave because it looked like it was about to go up and it was the fire was already crossing the road and part of the reason why it took us a little bit to get here was that my photographer and I Joe Perez we got separated and when he um tried to cross to get to my location the fire was way uh it was just too much he couldn't get through W it was right in the middle of the road and uh he had to go around so it's just been a very it's it's such a difficult uh time for the people who are living in this area this um eaten fire is just out of control and this wind is just not helping yeah I mean you're looking at that street sign that being completely barreled over by by the winds and which could be a very um dangerous projectile if that thing separates too um wow this is crazy and again the name of that facility is the two Palms Nursing Center two Palms Nursing Center are you with the facility no I'm not with the facility I'm just a helper bystander yes um and you're saying how many more patients there's like about six or seven down there that's where we're heading down there right now how far down like about two like two streets down two streets down yes well it's a difficult call we either walk down we leave our vehicles here and we don't know if the fire is going to get any closer um but we'll uh try to head on down yeah why don't you take a beat and you guys discuss amongst yourself the way that you think it's safest for you to go um we don't want to put any pressure on you in in terms of that um and and we will go back to you uh when you think that it's safe um but but wow what a scene what a scene right there and the human drama of all and and and looks like some great work by everybody and getting everybody out quickly that was something to the seniors uh being in wheelchairs being put into Swant vehicles uh to be taken to another senior facility or a nearby hospital We wish all of them the best of course 92 in all is what we're hearing uh evacuated from the two Palms Nursing Facility this is the live picture from Mount Wilson when we we first reported this fire um what more than 90 minutes ago it was 10 20 acres and there was just a small plume here and now that has just exploded and it reminds us of the Palisades fire of course that's the other big fire that we're covering and have been covering since that one erupted almost 12 hours ago at 10:30 this morning takes up our whole screen now uh it was just a small blip uh not that long ago all right let's go back to the other fire burning in Southern California Christy Hardo uh with the the Palisades fire Christie yeah in just the last couple of minutes we started getting very very heavy gust it's basically pushing us around and when that happened all the Flames everything that was on fire just exploded the Flames just got so much bigger and in the last live shot I showed you this is palis A's Charter Elementary and it is on fire when we went up the steps to look we saw that some buildings were burning others were not over here it looks like something perhaps a rock wall has also caught fire and this is the backside of the school this is the the part on swarf more and even in the last 10 minutes if we pound that way I can show you a house caught fire and further down the road multiple homes are burning in fact there was a man who drove out who told us that dozens of homes were on fire and as we were going down there it became too dangerous so we had to turn around but the conditions are just worsening they're not improving for firefighters these winds are just blowing Embers all over the place and we're seeing palm trees Catch Fire sadly homes a school also businesses on Dela Cruise a business there looks like it's a total loss it's right next to the Frontier Communications building vegetation on the frontier is Comm ation building has also burned but fortunately it does not look like the building has and down the road from us going in the opposite direction closer to Via de laaz we are starting to finally see firefighting resources we saw a couple of fire trucks with that other direction and just a few minutes ago a Cal Fire pickup went through here and seem to be surveying the area and if we pan to the right see another home is burning and again as I said a man told us that further down the street he saw dozens and dozens of homes burning he's a property owner he had gone to check on his properties he said it was not safe so he got out he also advised us not to go down there either and this is the house that I showed you earlier and now it looks like it's a total loss that house there was on fire and then cut this one on fire and if we can to the right you can see these flames and the rain of Embers have ignited other homes on fire as well so that is the latest right now from swwa Moore let's send it back to you one devastating scene after the other uh Christy vardo thank you you and your crew stay safe uh we we want to we have some new video into The Newsroom and this is from a a Stringer a photographer on the scene from tnla s hirs who shot some video of an injured firefighter being rescued by calfire it looks like uh getting tended to here and I believe that s is on the line with us right now s are you there yeah I'm here thanks for having me yeah thanks for the great work that you do uh so tell us about this incident this is while fighting the Palisades fire one injured firefighter yeah that's right I'm not exactly sure what agency that uh that firefighter was with but uh they put out a Mayday call um apparently she may have had some sort of Blow To The Head um and she was in unknown condition so we were uh just right down the street filming some of the uh destruction that um that ensued prior to that incident and uh we got there pretty quick and we saw uh calfire Crews as well as some lafd Personnel um lifting her on a uh you know on a on a thing um and they put her on the back of a pickup truck and ended up transporting her out of the fire zone so it was a definitely a pretty hectic scene very crazy um and I just hope she's going to be okay was she conscious was she talking to them uh she it looked like her eyes were open I didn't see her um I didn't see her physically talking or anything but her eyes were open which is a good sign so this is the Palisades fire what location was this within the Palisades uh this was on Bo boodo Street and uh Via de laaz okay so yeah I mean we've seen we've been reporting all day you know and it's been great to report the only good thing that we can report is we haven't heard of any injuries uh so at least we know of unfortunately at least one firefighter injured in this fir fight uh did you see anyone else being treated while you were there no not while I was there that was the uh luckily the only injury that that I did witness um but like I said you know just hope she's going to be okay so can you talk to us about your reporting experience tonight what's it been like for you out on the roads yeah I mean it's just been the most apocalyptic scene that you could that you can imagine I mean um we've been here all day we have a team of five photographers that have been here all day um and you know it started off you know obviously very intense and and and everything but um as you know the winds kind of intensified towards the the evening um things just have gotten way out of control um the fire activity is extremely erratic um the wind is just so unpredictable blowing in all directions uh you know they had to cancel the aircraft from above so that was a big um you know a big blow for firefighting efforts um but necessary um and you know it's just like I said it's just extremely apocalyptic that's the only way to really describe it wow well we hope that you and your crew remain safe HS freelance photographer from tnla uh thanks so much for the work that you do thank you he was talking about the winds let's talk more about the winds from the expert on that front um our meteorologist Adam Krueger has been tracking that all day yeah guys and so as expected the winds intensifying tonight we're seeing that just play out in the video it's just amazing images I'm going to start with some of the evacuation Maps though and I want to remind anyone who's around this area might be concerned you can see this for yourself at . ca.gov you can zoom in street level and see whatever you want but this is for the eaten fire now so we're looking north of Pasadena we have this large red area that's an evacuation order that's mandatory then we have evacu evacuation warnings which are optional but they may change over to orders so people in the warning areas need to be ready to go if that order comes through uh we see this now south of the evacuation order but also now East just north of Sierra Madre we see an evacuation order there as well give you a little perspective here's Pasadena and this little spot right here on the left side of your screen is is the Rose bll uh so again we're talking about this area kind of North and Northeast of Pasadena that's the eaten fire then of course you know about what's going on in the Pacific Palisades we have that evacuation order that extends to just into the northern section of Santa Monica this is San vente right here and so North or west of there that's the evacuation order and then we have this area known as north of Montana so here's Montana in Santa Monica north of there in this yellow zone that's the evacuation warning which again is optional but you need to be ready to go if that turns in to an order all right now looking at the wind forecast and again we're just getting into it we can see from the video that the winds are are starting to spike at their strongest that we've had all day long uh we can hear it outside of our building here I've you know I haven't been here that long uh less than a year but it's it's I've never heard winds from inside our studio before outside and we're getting that happening right now uh we have had wind gusts pick up around Pacific Palisades uh we're looking at a forecast right here but gusts have been measured 40 50 maybe 60 MPH there's a few in between instruments weather instruments there around the Pacific Palisades but over towards Pasadena Altadena around the eaten fire we have had some uh there's more weather stations there and some of those are measuring around the Foothills wind gusts up to about 60 MPH but you get up into the mountain peaks and we've seen some gusts around 80 plus miles hour uh around that eaten fire and now as we look at the forecast again going through the night look at these big numbers right here many spots according to this model projected to see wind gusts at or above 60 MPH and it's it's going to be like this pretty much all night long I'll just get out of the way so here's a look at midnight this is a widespread thing for a lot of Southern California we hope other fires don't break out because if they do they're going to spread very quickly like what we've seen so far here we go into 4:00 in the morning not a whole lot has changed notice though the colors kind of filling in around more of Los Angeles as we get into about Sunrise here's 8: a.m. model says gust around 50 in Santa Monica which we've already seen uh tonight and then maybe gust around 50 in La now even you know aside from the fire risk there's just the fact that we could see wind damage over a large part of Southern California because of how strong these winds are trees could come down we've seen some instances of that we had a a crazy live view with um with Christy who was reporting an tree fell on a power line Sparks were flying and so there may be more of that starting to happen as we go through the night that's another thing to watch for here as we go through the day tomorrow notice once we get past noon it's not as intense as what we've been seeing will'll be past the worst of it by that point and the wind uh warnings expire at 600 p.m. tomorrow also the humidity running very low we've seen it below 20% today it will get drier though as we go into tomorrow relative humidity drops below 10% in some spots so again winds are picking up right now they'll be at their Peak really from about now through about 9:00 a.m. and the humidity goes lower tomorrow two things working against us just to kind of wrap this all up with a map of the warnings we've got that high wind warning all areas in yellow most of southern California that's in effect until 6 p.m. tomorrow and then we see the red flag warnings which has to do with the wind and in the dry conditions and conditions that are favorable for fire for fires to spread so that's an effect through Wednesday but also Thursday not for LA and parts of LA County but all these other areas this remains in effect into Thursday and then the last thing I'm going to show you here is a fire weather watch that extends into Friday so this is an area that may switch over to a Red Flag Warning once we get a little closer to it which means this is basically four days likely it'll end up being four days of red flag warnings the worst of the Winds yes they end after the the end of the day tomorrow but still it's going to be Breezy with dry conditions and some type of Santa Ana winds likely to last into Friday and so you know it's a it's a long week here it's already been a long day it's going to be a long week where we really need to pay close attention to what's going on we'll head back to you now all right Adam we thank you so much uh let's bring in Christy vardo she's had some really dangerous situations behind her and she joined us now live from the firefight in the Palisades Christie yeah Marlo we have talked so much about how this is a wind driven fire and also how unpredictable it is and we're seeing evidence of that right here when we walked by 5 minutes ago you did not see all of these Embers that are flying and we'll get a gust and then you'll see them fly up into the air you can see some over there and if you watch closely they're going in different directions they're it's almost like a whirlwind and they're landing on homes and if we pan that way you can see something is burning behind there I know that there is a power pole that is on fire but uh that much of a glow suggests that's something much larger as well and those Embers that you saw flying are actually coming from Palisades Charter Elementary something is burning right on the other side of that fence we've watched that fire come in our direction we're actually on swathmore and the rain of Embers have ignited other fires in fact I showed you the some homes that were burning earlier now we're seeing multiple trees and at one point it looked like a car was going to go on fire there were Palm BRS that were underneath it that were burning and Gino who is behind the camera thought very quickly and he was able to move those fronds away from that car and that car luckily does not appear to be damaged but unfortunately there's really nothing we can do to save the homes and the elementary school and the other buildings that we see burning and also you heard firefighters and the LAPD telling people to evacuate hours ago and this is why the visibility is really really poor and you add to that all of the smoke and also the wind in fact Gino can you P this way look at the what the ambers are doing now Gino pen towards the school look want to show you there just was one giant gust and there there we go again Embers just flying everywhere and this is what firef Fighters are having to deal with and why they say this is like trying to stop a tornado there's really nothing you can do when these emers are whipping around like this and landing on homes and landing on vegetation they'll ignite sometimes blocks and blocks away so they could be finding a fire in one area not even know that another is on fire so witnessing very very tough conditions tonight for the firefight we's send it back to you that's an understatement as you know Christy and it's tough for you to be out there in the crew we appreciate you so much this is the Palisades fire we want to turn our attention back to the eaten fire this one erupted at 6:30 tonight so it's been about 3 hours this is our live picture from our Mount Wilson camera and those Flames now pretty much enveloping this whole Hillside uh at least 400 Acres have burned we just showed you and we've heard from you on social media about just how horrifying and heartbreaking the images are that we brought you live of those seniors more than 90 of them being evacuated from a senior facility uh taken by SWAT in fact uh to other local facilities Gina Silva she's moved you're on the ground where are you now yes sadly what you're watching is a house on fire this is the 2300 block of galbreth Road and unfortunately when we got here it was you know fully engulfed LA County firefighters immediately arrived and as you can see they are putting out the Flames there is a person here with a water hose who has been watering down the house but it wasn't doing much until the firefighters arrived one of the neighbors what is your name l so you guys were out here trying to help out I live right up the corner there we live in the same building together we were told to evacuate a while ago and we went down and dropped some stuff off but I came back up here because I saw all these spotf fires coming up here and I just I can't help but feel bad for all the people who live here and we've never had a fire like this I don't think in as far as I've been alive at least not down this close so I mean describe the wind conditions out here oh it's it's bad it's horrific I mean just driving in the car if you don't see any trees around the car shakes like it's an earthquake that's how strong it is how are you holding up how more that it's it's fine everything is fine yeah so no no no problem yeah where's your house from this uh yeah this one it's in the front and it's okay yeah yeah it's fine how long have you lived over here uh about 3 years there I think they live there a lot longer and your house is okay right now I is okay yeah I I think it's okay hopefully yeah well they're making really quick work obviously the uh LA County firefighters it's an emotional reunion they haven't seen each other so funny this is one of my best friends from high school oh how are you holding up under better circumstances it'd be so much nicer you hadn't seen each other in years a long time so last person I expect to see him is this guy but somehow he found his way up here yeah how are you I've been asking everybody how you're holding up with this I live in I live in Lana flge but my godmother she lives down the road and so I was on my way to her house cuz she got told to evacuate and then I saw this so we all just pitched in to help yeah I saw everybody moving in using water hes unfortunately it wasn't doing much because the Flames were so strong but as soon as the firefighters arried you can see now that the Flames are out there are obviously some hot spots but uh you know not as what it was you know when we first got here and I got to tell you you know we were doing uh the live report with the senior citizens who were being rescued and we ended up blocking a couple of blocks and we talk about how fast these fires move my car was parked at a 7-Eleven parking lot and I decided to walk back to get my car to come to this location and as soon as I got there there was a brush on fire there near my car had I not picked it up it probably would have gone up in Flames as well so it it just moves so fast these winds are just like something we've never seen before or not in a very long time and these Embers they just fly for miles and miles and start new fires new hotpots it's just absolutely insane so far as we've been reporting starting you know it started at 6:30 with only 20 acres and now has gone beyond 400 acres and it's growing you know it's just not uh we're not seeing any uh help from Mother Nature whatsoever get it back to you guys no and in fact overnight the winds are supposed to pick up as we've been hearing from our chief meteorologist Adam Krueger uh well into the morning so the firefight will be a brutal one uh we're not going to sugarcoat it at all because that would just be false information we we wish that we could bring you better news but the winds are still going to pick up overnight with those wind gusts in the Palisades uh clocking in at some points perhaps at 70 plus miles hour we'll see if that actually comes to fruition and because of that even if you don't live in one of these areas um that is having a fire right now but you live in an area that is fire prone um this this is a good time to make sure you have your bags packed and you have your valuables ready to go um because the chance of another fire like this starting somewhere else in Southern California tonight is not insignificant it would not be surprising if we looked at number three like this so if if this is a time to make sure your your bags are packed your stuff is ready to go if if need be you've thought it through so you're not shocked and surprised if in the middle of tonight you know something else breaks out because the fire the winds are supposed to be even worse between 10 p.m. which we're about to get to and 5:00 a.m. and uh the likelihood of another Fire Starting somewhere else is very high tonight um and so just know that as as you get ready to to go to bed tonight uh we want to take you to uh right outside the scene of Palisades High School Palisades Charter High School which we know their Athletics Fields burned and also some of the classrooms caught fire here's Matthew seedorf with photographer Sam Dubin you see uh we can walk across this street this is towards the football stadium I believe that is the score box on fire as we're going to turn this way with all these these Embers BL um I do have an anomer with me it's measuring measuring winds tting to 35 40 mph um with flames on the other side of the street as well see if we can push this way um and I'm actually with photojournalist Sam Dubin you went to this High School Sam if you don't mind what's this like uh it's heartbreaking this is myma M uh the baseball Field's totally gone some of the buildings are gone this house across the Street's gone uh this is the newer Aquatic Center the uh Maggie Gilbert Aquatic Center looks okay right now the classrooms appear okay but it's just heartbreaking for everyone who went to this school a lot of uh a lot of people have gone here over the years yeah I can't imagine um just seeing that especially as a as your Alma Moder and uh we're looking at looks like the pool right now and then looking across the street as we're battling these winds um more buildings have burned down um and just this thick black smoke again winds it just stings cuz of all this debris flying around um looking at myometer g 25 M hour right now but we've seen probably close to 40 um just uh it's hard to put this in the words seeing this home up here on fire and all these other structures and even a high school I'll go ahead and send it back to you Matthew uh thank you so much a live picture from Santa Monica our Santa Monica camera looking out of those Flames there uh we've seen this all afternoon since this fire broke out at 10:30 we want to show you the scene earlier though and this was one of the most uh surreal images that we've seen today in addition to all the homes that have burned this scene here these are a lot of cars that were abandoned by their car owners when they just got too afraid because the Flames were closing in on them and they abandoned their vehicles and as a result it blocked this entire roadway and so to get through emergency vehicles needed to get through and so la fire came in with the bulldozer and bulldozed all the cars out of the way and many of them Alex have been deemed total losses as a result yeah and just moved them like toys um and some really nice cars we're looking at in a really nice neighborhood um so we want to play for you if you're just joining us and you were at work earlier today and one information from the the Press briefing here is you're about to hear from uh the fire department spokesperson the chief of LAPD and the uh the chief of the LA fire department um here some of what they had to say a short uh a few hours ago the questions about Abandoned cars that that's a good question that has come up uh law enforcement assists us heavily with evacuation but please remember it's an active incident we don't have the answers to all of these questions we will certainly look at that that's very important I don't know if police felt like they wanted to uh make a mention to evacuations here okay yeah just on on that question of evacuations Vehicles left in the roadway uh if you have to leave a vehicle in the roadway get it as far off the road as you can so that emergency vehicles can't get by the gist of moving them with uh bulldozers was an emergency situation you got to get those fire resources through and they do what they have to do to be able to facilitate that so we're asking really for the cooperation and think a couple of steps ahead it's it's not just your vehicle there but then others like line up behind you as well as they see what you're doing and so uh I can't stress enough please follow the evacuation orders do your best to be able to get out to safety uh bring the equipment you you will need for the next couple of days with you because as you've heard over and over again this is not going to end very quickly no it's not and we're almost nearing 12 hours into this firefight in the Palisades uh we've been showing you these numbers for a while now they haven't been updated by calire our next briefing we had one at 3:30 this afternoon that's when we heard from LAPD Chief uh McDonald there who you just last heard from he was alongside Governor gavan nusum as well uh that next briefing of officials won't take place until 8: a.m. tomorrow from Zuma Beach so uh hopefully we'll get some updated numbers but in the meantime obviously we know that this whole area much of it is under mandatory evacuation because of the strong winds that will continue well into the night into the morning of Wednesday January the 8th and we're going to be on with you through at least midnight by the way so you can count on us go ahead uh so we take you from this picture maybe we can take our other picture which is from Mount Wilson which shows the eaten fire that we are uh also keeping track of and some news from Governor Nome who was at that press briefing earlier today in Pacific Palisades um he just announced that they have secured Federal funding for the eaten fire um so we already got Federal funding for the Palisades fire earlier in the day now the eaten fire also getting Federal funding from President Biden who just happens to be in Southern California tonight um and uh I think is kind of grounded because of what we've seen here um so he is also part of all of this tonight um but again these are the live pictures and every time we take this image from the Mount Wilson camera we see more and more Flames being wider and wider uh this started is just a small part of the shot and it now extends across the entire shot um at least 400 Acres burn we know that that number is now higher than that um and we see a lot of folks scrambling in the Altadena and Pasadena neighborhoods right now because of that fire and again a look back at the uh Pacific Palisades fire which you can see from our Santa Monica Cam and and really you can see from miles and miles in many different directions Christy Fardo is right in the middle of those Flames uh she's walking right now uh chrisy if you can hear us it's yours yeah we're actually on swathmore and we saw some fire engines down here so we decided to come down to investigate and sadly we're seeing another what looks like a home completely destroyed and what is really telling is that we keep seeing buildings like the one on the right that appear to be made of concrete there another one the Frontier Communications building that appears to be made of brick and those are fairing very well even when vegetation is going up around them they have not caught fire but we've been talking about the winds and you can see what they're doing with these Embers they hit those flames and they just whip up all of these Embers and if we pan that way you can see that they are carrying them down the street and towards buildings and homes that have not burned and that is why firefighters are stretched so thin there are so so many fires burning all at once and every one of these Embers that you see flying has the potential to start another fire so firefighters are trying to keep up with all of this but there's really no way to do so and over there on the right that is actually pate's charter elementary school and sadly we went up there I went up the steps and we took a look this is the back side of the school and multiple buildings were on some of the buildings have not burned we can only hope that they will stay that way but the playground would look like a rock wall and other structures look like a total loss and they've been on fire now for probably about 2 hours and we've seen Cal Fire coming through and looking at it but we've not seen any firefighters actually battling the fire at the school but again we are on the backside of the school and I've talked so much much about those Embers and what they do to palm trees and you can see evidence of it right there the palm tree across the street and the two three that we're looking at are all on fire and those Palm BRS unfortunately fall off the tree or they blow away and catch something else on fire and we've witnessed that a house that was ignited precisely because a palm pal FR that were burning were blown in its direction and we also saw a car almost Catch Fire because it was parked on some Palm FRS and those caught fire from those rain of Embers that you've seen and luckily Gino who was behind the camera noticed that he was able to pull the burning plump runs away from the car and save the car unfortunately we can't do that for the buildings you see here and most of the people in this neighborhood have evacuated although occasionally we'll see one car go by like the one you just saw but most of the people did heat it and fortunately because you would not want a mass of people trying to evacuate now visibility is very poor the winds are really really strong in fact I've been standing and almost knocked off my feet that's how powerful they occasionally are and that's also what firefighters are dealing with and what they fear at this hour let's send it back to you Chelsea uh pardon me Christy Christy Hardo there uh thank you so much Regino Aras thank you for all of your reporting tonight we want to go back to the eaten fire this is in Altadena Gina Silva you were just showing us a home there and this is the live picture again from our Mount Wilson camera that shows the Embers uh rather the Flames a glow on this Tuesday night as we approach the 1000 p.m. hour this eaten fire erupted at 6:30 tonight this is a multi- agency response including from Pasadena fire and and Angeles National Forest and LA County Fire uh let's check in with Gina Silva on the ground now Gina are you still in that same particular neighborhood I'm in the same neighborhood and you can see that there are multiple fir got to go next Tre okay please next tree thank you uh Pasadena uh police are telling us that we have to move and part of the reason is that uh we heard a loud explosion a little while ago we it was like a loud pop job and I were like what was that it did not sound good and there are several houses that are on fire I'm trying to get to the end of the street to find out what the name is of the street but as you can see this entire neighborhood is in trouble sir what's the name of the street Bell Vista B Vista Bell Vista Bell Vista Bell Vista so this is uh Bell Vista and uh all of these homes have been uh evacuated uh the officers are saying these uh all of these houses are obviously in danger they're in the path of this destru the fire that started at 6:30 and it continues to grow and it is just absolutely devastating because now we're seeing multiple homes on fire and the danger in that of course are the uh the gas lines you know everything I'm I'm hoping that by now everything's been turned off um but there were still some folks in homes that did not want to leave and officers are telling them please you've got to get going you've got to leave it is not safe and as I told you earlier you know it just moves so fast you're you're thinking you're safe in one location and then boom in the next moment you're not so it it is a a very precarious situation here U I believe that is Pasadena fire yep Pasadena firefighters uh are out there battling we've seen LA County firefighters as well and again there's a mandatory mandatory uh evacuation order for multiple communities we gave you the names earlier I believe that the all of those names uh of the streets uh have been um the mandatory evacuation has been extended to other locations as well but it's a very dangerous situation and obviously you just don't you don't want to be here I know we saw a couple of people in the other uh at the other home where they were just watering it down and it wasn't making much of a difference until the firefighters arrived and DST it with their large um you know equipment that they have their hoses and so that's the only way that you're going to be able to battle this fire other than that uh you know a little bit of water from the from the small garden hose is not going to make much difference unfortunately Alex Mara G Gina uh you've been covering Fires for a very long time and even some of our really bad fires lately you've been in the middle of H how does this compare to Other Stories you've covered over the course of your career oh this is insane I mean there's just no other way to describe this we earlier when we were showing you the woman bringing out the horses we were surrounded by flames on both sides and it was just getting stronger and stronger so we had to leave that location and and of course the wind it is just so strong that at times it's hard to stand in one location we've seen many down trees uh we saw that uh sign that was toppled over I mean it's just absolutely insane I don't think I've ever seen winds this extreme and are you seeing that people are heating the call to evacuate yes yes for the most part people have left there are some who are still kind of hanging around you know I I understand it's their home you know they don't want to lose it but again your life is more important than property because that can be eventually replaced but uh you want to be safe and that's what firefighters uh police officers are always telling us you know just befe safe get out let the professionals try to handle the situation and they are there are so many agencies out here there's LA County fire passagen of fire um different agencies that I cannot name right now and I have to move out of the way here um but they're here battling and unfortunately there are so many fires that are taking place right now that's calire just arriving now um that it's impossible to be at all the places that are just going up in flames right now it's just crazy yeah and of course we know the last number we heard was well it started at 10 20 acres and then exploded to 400 and uh you know we're waiting for calire perhaps they'll be the agency to update the number Angeles National Forest perhaps but it's well beyond the 400 we could imagine yeah and that's growing you know that is growing right now as we mentioned the names of the streets where there are evacuation orders that's for kinoa Canyon Road out Post Lane Glenn Springs kage Miranda Roosevelt vernada Ken Clair and areas east of Altadena Drive I'm sure by now um that list has grown because this fire keeps moving spreading we know that you're on the eaten fire but we're just getting this Vital Information about the Palisades fire we had shown earlier video of the female firefighter being tended to uh now we're hearing that that Fe 25 5-year-old female firefighter did sustain a serious head injury while fighting the Palisades fire she was treated at the scene and then taken to a hospital this is from La FD itself and then this multiple burn victims according to lafd were reported walking toward duk's Malibu restaurant we know that right on PCH approximately 9:00 tonight again this is according to lafd spokesperson Captain Eric Scott uh incident operations redirect directed medical resources to that location to provide evaluation and treatment so we've been reporting no injuries we know at least one firefighter has been injured and now multiple burn victims reportedly being treated at Dukes uh in Malibu the restaurant there along PCH wow uh so there is so much going on tonight we thank you for joining us for this special prime time uh coverage uh we are now going to reset and give you update information on everything for the time that we usually join you every night which is the Fox 11 News at 10: and we are going to start that coverage out tonight uh with a look at some of the most dramatic images that we've experienced together during our last 12 hours of coverage this home seems like it's being considered a loss there are so many homes that are in danger how many more horses do you have we have a a couple we just let loose over there we're trying to get as many as we can out there's 12 yeah I know they're pretty wired up when the wind's blowing amb they don't really know what to do everyone right I always have a bag packed sunset's already backed up and people are fighting and the only access Ingress at egress is Tesco Canyon and Sunset Boulevard we just watched the last one on that Terrace burn to the ground good evening welcome to a special edition of the fox L News at 10 I'm Alex Michaelson and I'm marotos here for Christine Divine the fast moving Wildfire Pacific Palisades has burned almost 3,000 Acres forcing thousands to evacuate the fire is fueled by those strong San Ana winds by midafternoon it had grown rapidly threatening over 13 18,000 structures including more than 10,000 homes containment tonight at 0% mandatory evacuations cover much of the area with nearby Malibu issuing warnings as well firefighters began using air tankers and helicopters to battle the Flames but both are grounded tonight because of the wind and we want to show you these images that we're showing you right here this is a live picture from our Santa Monica cam off in the distance those are the flames in the hillside in the the Palisades now evacuation routes were jammed with some residents abandoning cars and fleeing on foot Palisades Charter High School has been hit hard its baseball field athletic fields grounds they've been destroyed so the fire started this morning near Pedra Morada and Monta Hermosa drives officials warn that worsening winds over night could spread the farther even further smoke advisories are now in effect residents are urged to stay indoors the fire's cause still not known uh we have seen some injuries reported in the last hour the mandatory evacuation Zone has expanded to the East and North here's this wide swath of red that gives you an idea of how big it is the map from LA City fire shows the scope of evacuation orders that remain in effect for areas north to mahand Road East to kenter Road and South to Pacific Coast Highway way Pacific Coast Highway is closed from Santa Monica's McClure tunnel to toena Canyon with LAPD managing traffic residents are urged to turn off power before leaving and those near the evacuation Zone should prepare a go bag and stay informed through lafd alerts and of course your local news now the Westwood recreation center is open as an evacuation and overnight shelter which accommodates small animals that's located at 1350 South seula Boulevard large animals can be taken to the LA Equestrian Center which is in Burbank we have live team coverage tonight meteorologist Adam Krueger is watching those wins Fox 11's Gina Silva she's on the eaten fire that one erupted tonight at 6:30 in Altadena Ed lascos has reaction from devastated homeowners in Pacific Palisades and right now this is a live look from the ground in pal AES yeah is this Ed Lasco picture Ed I don't know if you can hear used yeah you got it yeah I'm sorry yeah yeah actually we have just moved inside our live van it's too threatening out there these winds blowing hurricane Force I swear to you there I've never seen anything like this you can see the Embers blowing through here the cross here is sunset we at Via de laaz uh right where the 76 gas station is here at gillson and what you're looking at used to be on the Northern end of this uh intersection a two or three story apartment building Condo building that's stretched up a couple of blocks it has been burning wall of flames the last couple of hours coming down closer to Sunset there's a gas station on the far side and the 76 closer to this side but as these winds blow through here you have a shower of Embers you see a little bit of them going through here and wait till we get a very strong gust it's a consistent wind but you get the sustained gust that actually have this this live van swaying back and forth and over to the left is Also Mikey will give you a look some of the that's the parking lot of Gelson's and an idea of these uh Embers that have been a big problem for firefighters behind us is Ratcliff we've been looking at that the last couple of hours several homes over there also burned to the ground we've been watching that the last couple of hours Ratcliffe runs parallel to T mesal Canyon but it's right here in the heart of the village itself look at these Embers look at this oh the truck moving around these Embers blowing through here it's a firestorm over in this area and again when these Embers blow through and the wind picks up you see what's left of that the condo building the apartment building on the corner it just Roars to life and the fire the winds pushing it this way pushing it toward PCH which means there are still many homes on this area on the south side of sunset still in Jeopardy here as this fire very much out of control one other point we're seeing a lot more fire engines moving through here strike teams moving through if you will the last couple of hours from LA City moving up to the northern part of sunset here as something we did not see on rat Cliff earlier look at that over there look at the uh the Embers is just blowing around almost like a tornado effect of Embers as this wind swirls through here so you have the Embers you have the wind and then you have visibility down that to nothing as the smoke just comes through here and a wall of fire but unfortunately this this building apartment building is lost evacuated we heard no injuries there everybody got out in time a block over to our right to the east the CVS Pharmacy across the street several restaurants there well known to a lot of folks here in the village they're gone I just looked at them burnt right to the ground so damage here extremely severe unbelievable when you're into heart of the Palisades that this is kind of a fire you usually see up in the hills somewhere in the canyons but nothing that comes right through the the heart of a downtown area like we're seeing at this moment Ed lasos thank you so much on the line now is Margaret Stewart with LA City fire thank you so much for taking the time out where does the firefight stand tonight as those winds are picking up we have not seen the worst of the Winds yet uh from now through the rest of the night they're forecasted to be worsening so unfortunately this dangerous situation you know is we're nowhere near over um it's super important that everyone follows the evacuation orders um you showed the map earlier basically anyone within Pacific Palisades area all the way up to mohand um as well as Santa Monica has now issued evacuations on that portion to the southeast of our map that hits Santa Monica there's also evacuations there um we do know that we have injuries reported uh we have a 25-year-old female lafd firefighter sustained a serious head injury and there are multiple burned victims that were being treated and transported so we ask people to please get out stay out uh and let us get in there and do our very best against this very um extreme fire weather do you have any more information about those injuries how uh the firefighter is doing and and maybe any more details about the burn injuries these are the folks that came to Dukes right to with injuries yes I I we don't have details um as you can imagine it's a very Dynamic situation so they were transported and taken care of so we just don't have those kind of details right now and our firefighter was transported to the hospital hospital and we don't have an update Margaret what do you want our viewers to know tonight as you know you just talked about the worst is yet to come uh given that what's your word to them if they if there is anyone still in the evacuation Zone IM immediately leave um we cannot you we redirecting resources to try to um rescue people out who should have already left takes away from our firefighters out there defending homes and saving lives so please leave now as well as anyone you know this is burning in a generally Western Direction however the fire creates added winds and then those Embers um can travel which is why our evacuation Zone you know is going in all directions so anyone bordering the the current evacuation Zone needs to stay aware they need to stay informed um they can follow our updates Le fd.org alerts they can get them to their phones or to their email uh they need listen to the and watch the local news they need to have a go bag ready the car facing out in the driveway have a plan in place and if they do get the order then evacuate early and quick there are some people that may have stayed behind who just look at this and now are scared to leave or maybe they don't know where to go or it's you know all all the Flames are around them or the fire trucks are are nearby it's not easy to get in and out of these regions what do you say to those people where to go how to get out well there there are law enforcement and firefighters you know spread throughout the entire area so if they see someone they can ask for assistance and'll and direct them out um this is why we ask people not to stay behind we know that there's the desire to do so however these winds are unprecedented in in our recent you know we haven't had winds like this in a very long time and it's very dangerous and it's not worth trying to protect a building when we want to protect your life earlier there was the call that was put out by your agency lafd um asking any off-duty member to call because you need all basically hands on deck how are your resources tonight um yes and I also do just want to clarify for anyone watching there was a misunderstanding that that kind of went out across different channels that this is a recall protocol for lafd members only not we're not asking for volunteers or any other firefighters so we have a recall um process that we execute when needed and those that are off duty call in and we can then schedule out any additional resources so that process is underway by our department Operation Center and and we have the resources to manage that and and talk also about the concern because this is the fire it's burning now um but the winds are supposed to be worse as you mentioned and there's not an insignificant chance that there could be another fire that breaks out overnight you know it's it's entirely possible um we can't you we can't predict what what might happen in that regards um we do also have uh the state agency calfire the incident management team is going to be taking over the incident in the morning and they are also the agency that coordinates resources from across the state to respond so I I don't have details on what what the plan is right now but they can call in resources from you know outside the region any other parting thoughts before we let you go no doubt you're busy yeah really we just want to emphasize you know our program Ready set go everyone needs to be ready they need to have their bag prepared have a communication plan in place any important medications stuff for your pets um have that already because if you are in the in the the expand as if as it were to expand especially towards the west and south you need to already be prepared so stay aware stay aware and stay ready Margaret Stewart with lafd we thank you for taking the time out tonight thanks for all the hard work that your Crews do and you stay safe as well thanks byebye we're going to go to Chelsea Edwards now who is on the ground who has been reporting for us near Pacific Coast Highway uh Chelsea not sure if Chelsea can hear us um when she's ready we will go back to her in the mean time we look at this live picture from our Santa Monica cam as this fire continues to get worse and we really see those winds are whipping up uh let's go to Chelsea now Chelsea uh if you can hear us we are now driving north on PCH wow that is a fireball on the right hand side so the fire is now on both sides of PCH oh there's another home up in flames on the right hand side so it's on both sides right near the intersection at Sunset Boulevard we've kind of been in one place for a lot of this evening and a lot of this afternoon uh but now we're we're mobile and we're heading toward Malibu we're getting reports that there are some homes on the PCH side that are now up in flam so that's where we're headed toward the tapena area uh what we're seeing on PCH is just something else I mean these hillsides are just lit up home that's another one home after home after home after home I I can feel the heat coming from the side of the truck from from the right hand side where we're we're sitting now we're enclosed in the truck I can also feel the wind just knocking the truck I mean these these news Vans are very topheavy you know we've got the the gear on the top and they're very tall and I can feel it just grabbing it and kind of tossing it around as we're driving up PCH so the visibility extremely low we can only see about 20 ft in front of us I would say as we're oh I don't know about this Elliott um very low visibility and a lot of particles in the air uh and again just this glow from from all up the hillside we're actually in an area now where the fire no longer seems to be burning but the smoke is so incredibly thick we can barely see in front of us with our with our headlights on uh so it appears that at least that portion of the fire of the Pacific the Pacific Palisades fire is you know in that area but again we're hearing these reports there are there are some situations up in the Malibu area closer toward toena so that's where we're heading right now we're hoping to be able to give you a live picture you know our camera has been up for the last seven hours or so just feeding back live ellot what is this is this the Feed Barn all right I think I don't want to misreport here but I believe this is you know the iconic Feed Barn uh near to panga Canyon yeah that is that's gone um all right so we've just passed to penga Canyon wow that whole thing is just flattened which means that we're coming up toward the real in and cholat tie now on the left hand side it's just spot fires uh this fire jumped the PCH and burned everything that's on this side I'm not seeing any homes on the left hand side which is the PCH side yet but wow oh the destruction here you know what this is the real in right here it's gone the real in is gone there's nothing there chot a tie gone yeah I I saw those images actually a little earlier tonight in fact those are on my social media the real in chilada um all of that has been wiped out that was at least three hours ago uh that those Flames just wiped out those obvious the devast I may have lost you Marlin Alex no you're there all right we're we're coming up now um to some fire activity oh look no it is on this side it is on the left side now so we've got several fire engines here this is a first actually for tonight we oh yes homes on the PCH side now are on fire uh this is something we we've not seen in a long time um meaning on on the side of PCH closer to the ocean yes to the ocean so the ocean side of PCH there's one actively uh on fire right now I can see what was with the left of another one that's just to our left we have a huge firefighting presence here and again we we have not seen that at least for property protection since we started you know at 2:00 this afternoon or 1:30 this afternoon this is the first time we've actually seen a firefight where they're trying to protect these properties these homes on the left hand you know on the ocean side of PCH um so they've got an active firefight up ahead oh there's more homes up there this is this is quite a few homes now that are impacted on the PCH side wow um we're going to get a little bit closer we're going to see how far they'll let us in with our news down without you know impeding the firefighting efforts and see if we can get our live texture back up get these batteries working again to show you what we're seeing CU this is this is pretty remarkable this is something else yeah and I wonder also if if uh your phone is working if if maybe Zoom is potentially an option too um to get some images out of there if need be um but uh Chelsey um thanks for all your your extraordinary reporting all day long and um but really sad updates there to hear about so many iconic spots along the coast that so many of us have enjoyed for years um and you think of all the people that are imp impacted by this um all the employees all the customers everybody um that we're going to be talking about this and dealing with this for many years to come uh Chelsea stay safe we'll get back with you soon thanks guys all right uh our coverage continues here on Fox 11 the Palisades fire of course in the Palisades and then the eaten fire that's the other fire that we're looking at tonight that is in Altadena both are proving to be uh especially difficult fire fights because of those destructive winds which we knew were were coming uh we got wind of this no pun intended uh last week when Adam Krueger was forecasting that in fact Adam I why don't you join the coverage now and give us an update on as we're past 10:00 and those wind speeds are expected to pick up yeah you know it's just uh it's a little overwhelming everything that's going on I mean you see just bad news after bad news we it's the unfortunate scenario we have and yes the winds have picked up in the last hour or so you might remember going into this with the high wind warnings the National Weather Service was saying at worst there may be some isolated spots where gusts are as high as 80 to 100 milph that didn't quite pan out earlier in the day today but we knew the strongest winds were coming and now I see verification at least on some of the higher elevation weather sensors for example there's one that's about halfway between Malibu and the Pacific Palisades measured a 98 m per hour gust about an hour ago and we're seeing some gusts get over 90 mph in the San Gabriel mountains uh a little bit nor north of Pasadena where we have that other fire going on the eaten fire as well um so the it's coming to fruition right now the strongest winds are are happening right now they are peaking they're expected to stay about this strong all through the night and up through about 9:00 tomorrow morning then the speeds at least start slowly but surely backing down a little bit another thing that does not work in our favor heading into tomorrow is the air gets even a little bit drier tomorrow than what we're seeing today and I do want to note that while we're focused a lot on where these fires are going on there are extreme weather conditions happening all across Southern California right now and even if you take the fire aspect out of this it's a a major wind event just simply the winds there's going to be a lot of wind damage likely across a lot of Southern California as well uh I want to show you just real quickly some of these evacuation Maps I know it's kind of scrunched in right here but this is the uh Pacific Palisades fire right here here's the evacuation order that extends into the Northern parts of Santa Monica San viente is kind of the border between the order which is mandatory and the evacuation warning which is optional but you know you might want to get ready to go if you have to that goes all the way down to Montana Avenue in Santa Monica fire.ca.gov if you want a closer look at some of these Maps I'll also show you near the eaten fire what the evacuation uh map looks like so Pasadena here is on the left part of the screen uh the Rose Bowl is kind of tucked right on the edge right there so we're a far distance from that but again here's the eaten fire a lot of that spreading South you see the evacuation order then a few of these evacuation warnings which are suggested but not mandatory in those yellow spots right there all right now on to the forecast winds and this is going to look a lot like what you've seen me show many times here throughout the day today not a whole lot has changed in the forecast but we're in the thick of it right now we're starting at 11:00 p.m. and you'll see just some big numbers across the map forecast wind gust 60 70 m per hour we know some of those higher elevations will be even a little bit stronger than that here we go all the way through the night into tomorrow morning this is 4:00 in the morning now not a whole lot of changes with our forecast here's 8:00 in the morning we are still dealing with extremely strong winds even in La uh there could be some gusts around 50 or so that could cause some damage for sure now as we go a little later into the day this is a look at noon it's still very windy but you see the numbers are not to the extreme levels that we expect during the night time and then as we go through the day on Wednesday here's a look at a little bit later in the afternoon 4 in the afternoon we're seeing again slight Improvement but still quite windy if you're wondering by the way kind of to get into the science of what's going on why the winds are peaking right now and why they're expected to be at their strongest over right it has to do what's go what's uh going on a little higher up in the atmosphere something we call the jet stream have heard that term before it's basically like a river a fast moving winds high up in the atmosphere where the planes are flying around and the jet stream pattern the winds kind of are going around this low right now but right next to this low right in this circle right here if you look at these streamlines you'll notice how they're moving especially quick right here there's a very fast moving part of the jet stream that's going from north to south down California uh these same conditions cause 100 35 mph gust at the summit of Mammoth Mountain by the way uh and so we got those really strong winds right overhead right now in the higher parts of the atmosphere and some of those winds are making their way down to the surface which is giving us the extra boost the extra enhancement to the wind gust now as we go through the night into tomorrow this starts shifting a little farther south this is noon tomorrow by that point the intense part of those jet stream winds will be a little farther south and that's why our winds start backing down by that point but high wind warnings those are in effect until 6 p.m. tomorrow so that gives you an idea of the worst of the Winds continue into tomorrow again the peak though should start to come down after about 9 or 10:00 tomorrow morning then we have the Red Flag Warning you know all about that that's in effect through tomorrow but also for a lot of the area what we're looking at here it continues into Thursday excludes a portion of Los Angeles down to Long Beach for example and then Friday there's a fire weather watch which will likely change to a Red Flag Warning at some point which means this will have been 4 days of red flag warnings even though the winds are most intense tonight into tomorrow morning it's still a Santa Ana wind event with Gusty conditions in some spots and dry conditions that goes all the way into Friday so our guard needs to stay up for a couple more days but especially tonight and into tomorrow with the strongest winds here in our area and the lowest humidity still yet to come tomorrow and um again you know the just in the last hour we've seen some of the strongest wind gust so far today and we know today earlier was quite bad it's just getting even more extreme right now the live shots we see from our reporters hats off to them and the crews that are out there it is incredible to see and you can hear from from the way they're telling the stories right I mean they a lot of them have been reporting in this area for a long time uh they're saying that I mean they've never been in anything like this this is just a a historic wind event that's unfolding right now across our area guys back to you all right thank you so much Adam uh we want to get you the latest information about the injuries that we can now report unfortunately we do know that a 25-year-old old female firefighter with lfd was hurt tonight while battling the Palisades fire here's that image of her being loaded on to the bed of a truck here this happened near bod do street and Via de laaz uh she sustained according to uh lafd spokesperson Eric Scott a serious head injury she was treated out the scene and she was taken to a hospital for more evaluation and treatment we spoke to the person who shot this video freely journalist s hirs with tnla I'm not exactly sure what agency that uh that firefighter was with but uh they put out a Mayday call um apparently she may have had some sort of Blow To The Head um and she was in unknown condition so we were uh just right down the street filming some of the uh destruction that um that ensued prior to that incident and uh we got there pretty quick and we saw a calfire Crews as well as some lfd Personnel um lifting her on a uh you know on a on a thing um and they put her on the back of a pickup truck and ended up transporting her out of the fire zone so it was a definitely a pretty hectic scene very crazy um and I just hope she's going to be okay was she conscious was she talking to them uh she it looked like her eyes were open I didn't see her um I didn't see her physically talking or anything but her eyes were open which is a good sign uh let's hope that she's okay this some videos from earlier the historic Getty Villa in the Palisades has experienced at least some damage to its ground trees plants there have burned we do not believe that the structure itself caught on fire um the executive director saying that the art collection remains safe Museum's Galleries and library archives are protected from Smoke by state-of-the-art air Handling Systems the double walled construction of the galleries providing some protection uh the Getty Villa will remain close through at least Monday um and let's hope uh at first light tomorrow we things stay the way that they looked right here and that the structure itself is okay all right from the Palisades fire let's go to the eaten fire this is time- Lapse video of that fire which started just before 6:30 tonight Altadena Drive uh right near Altadena Drive it has grown to at least 400 Acres it's damaged structures it's forced evacuations crews are working to protect homes and hazardous materials in that area All Saints Church in Pasadena has opened its doors to shelter people affected by the eaten fire that church is located at 132 North uid Avenue also Pasadena Convention Center is also serving as an evacuation Center for those impacted by the eaten Fire Fox 11 Gina Silva has been covering that fire for the past several hours she's live and wow uh look at this um another structure engulfed right now yes unfortunately another house in fact there are four on the 1100 block of Bella Vista are on fire it is just absolutely devastating some more down the street that are yeah you know we're having some audio problems with her mic um obviously uh you know a lot of technical challenges in making reporting happen here uh but in the meantime let's stay on this shot uh from joab Perez on the ground there we're seeing some water from the firefighters got ending up on his lens um but Gina just said that multiple homes on this street um have burned um we have seen that in multiple streets in Southern California at this Point um where sometimes multiple uh homes go up uh the good news is that it looks like there are firefighters there um there's not much that they can do to save this house um but they hope to be able to protect other homes Gina I think your audio issues have been figured out um let's try this again take it away can you hear me can hear you go ahead [Music] yeah as I was saying this is the 1100 block of Bella Vista and there are four homes that are on fire if you look down the street there's one 2 three and then this one that's on fire and take a look at the palm trees I mean you can see how strong these flame these winds are and it's just moving those Embers and the Flames onto the next house onto the next house and that's what we've been seeing is just a devastating fire that started at 6:30 with just you know up in the hillside Eden Canyon about 20 acres it has grown to more than 400 I'm sure that number is well above 400 now and it gets it just keeps getting worse there are multiple agencies here battling this place LA County Fire Pasadena fire Cal Fire but as we've been moving from place to place you know there are so many homes so many structures that are going up there's just not enough firefighters to battle this Inferno yeah I mean it's very very similar to the Palisades fire as well you know more heartbreaking images across the Southland tonight uh Gina uh we thank you and earlier Gina had an incredible life shot of an uation of a senior facility Center in Altadena we have that video to show you if you didn't see that earlier it'll break your heart uh we were told that 92 seniors had to be evacuated the winds were howling it was a whole lot of uncertainty you can just look at all of these patients most of them in wheelchairs unable to walk and just the chaos out there there was a SWAT team from Pasadena Police that actually loaded a bunch of um these patients into that SWAT vehicle to transport them we got some answers from officials uh the reason why they were evacuated is because their senior living facility was around the corner and the Flames had just jumped the street so of course their building was being threatened they were going to be taken we were told to other neighboring senior facility centers and then also to uh local hospitals if need be and here's an image you don't see every day and one of those patients inside the SWAT vehicle as far as we understand all 92 did get out and did get transported so good news there Alex yeah this is the two Pals Nursing Center in Altadena um and you just saw that there just chaos to get these people out as quickly as possible all of them facing their own medical challenges here's a little bit of sound from from this there we live in the same building together we were told to evacuate a while ago and we went down and dropped some stuff off but I came back up here because I saw all these spot fires coming up here and I just I can't help but feel bad for all the people who live here and we've never had a fire like this I don't think in as far as I've been alive at least not down this close so I mean describe the wind conditions out here oh it's it's bad it's horrific I mean just driving in the car if you don't see any trees around the car shakes like it's an earthquake that's how strong it is L how are you holding up one more St it's it's fine everything is fine yeah so no no no problem yeah where's your house uh this one it's in the front and it's okay yeah yeah it's fine how long have you lived over here uh about 3 years there I think they live there a lot longer and your house is okay right now I is okay yeah I I think it's okay hopefully yeah well they're making wow uh so we're back now with live pictures o look look at that um this this is this home which is going to be a total loss firefighters doing the best they can to contain the damage and stop these Embers from starting even more fires nearby and you look at the lights that remind us of Christmas and the joy of the holiday season and and then we see those very ugly pictures of all the destruction uh and sort of a reminder of the best days in the worst days in one picture all right let's go to Chelsea Edwards she was driving along PCH where the Flames have jumped over to the ocean side and you were literally seeing homes oceans side burning Chelsea Mara at least five that we can see right now from where we are we're in the 18,000 block of PCH look at what we can see from inside this news band so you see these homes they're all obviously they're packed together here on PCH as you know they're right next to each other a lot of them kind of sharing their walls but look at that one that's just fully engulfed at the end there and we're seeing these firefighter efforts see that hose that they've thrown on uh that they're they're trying to put these out I mean this is the first actual fire fighting effort that we have seen so far today everywhere that we have been I mean everywhere else we've been it has been lifes saving but this is the first time that we've seen them trying to save properties uh some of these homes though are just a total loss Elliot can you show the one that's right across from where we're parked this one for example look at this so this was obviously a full home at one point look there's there's there's nothing left you can see straight through to the ocean now um I mean the the ferociousness of these Flames is just something to behold oh did you see the Flames pop up over that house right there Elliot so now just across from us again this is only 18,000 block of PCH this is on the beach side of PCH looks like something is burning on the beach side of that home so that indicates at least to me that these have to be produced by Embers I mean if you know homes are Lighting on this side of the you know of the PCH this has to be driven by Embers and then of course because the proximity these these homes are so close together they just spread from house to house we're also seeing a home right there the kind of pink one I can see better now that they've got a light on it the authorities have a light on it but it looks like the garage has burnt out that's it looks like it's kind of leaning out toward PCH that's right behind where they've got that hose going where they're trying to to save this one property right next to it but from what we can tell at least five homes here total losses here in the 18,000 block of PCH uh firefighters here trying to do what they can to save the homes that are remaining it looks like they've moved on from the home that's actively engulfed down at the end of of our vantage point right here uh looks like they're not even trying for that one kind of as to what the Fire official that we spoke to earlier tonight who said it's it's kind of like triage I mean you just have to move from home to home and if you know one is going to be a total loss we don't waste our time trying to save it I mean we have to move on to other things so that's what it appears is happening here they've moved on from the the shells of these homes that are engulfed and are now trying to save these homes in the middle but the home you know the homes to the left of all of this are gone there's nothing there's nothing blocking our view now from here to the ocean and so it looks like they're trying to save these standing homes in the middle but again we're seeing Flames now on the beach side of this home here on PCH which is not a good sign that is indicates that they are you know actively on fire as well so this is just something else um you know these are very nice homes very expensive homes along PCH uh just I've never seen anything like this before Phelps and Mar no and and some bad news to share because we've been warning about the possibility of another fire um and uh we want to let you know about a new fire which we've just found out about which is called the silar fire uh so we are watching the eaten fire in Pasadena we're watching the Pacific Palisades fire but there is now a fire in Silmar uh that the LA fire department says is uh at least 50 acres rapid rate of spread there's an evacuation orders in place north of the 210 Freeway from Rockford to the interstate 514 freeway split uh so that is the Silmar fire at least the third major fire we are dealing with uh tonight we'll try to get to you some pictures of that more information on that in the meantime we go back to Altadena where Gina Silva is looking at the eaten fire and just destruction underway right now could I ask you a few questions from live on Fox sure okay come on over joob okay are you okay guys so we're in the same neighborhood and uh you can see that we are surrounded by fire all around us there are multiple houses on fire we've got uh what is your name assistant chief all right so Chief just describe this scenario for us we are in a real serious firefight and uh we are losing a lot of homes the winds are just they're they're really not helping us at all the winds are are really bad and uh it's sending Ember cast and we're trying to keep ahead of the fire and it's it's proving to be difficult what is the name of this street this is Woodland this is that'sa yes and on this street we're seeing how many homes my goodness several several and we're losing more and uh so we have limited resources we're trying to get all the resources we can into this area but uh we're doing the best we can have you ever dealt with these type of winds uh it hasn't been like this since I've been here since the Wooley fire that's the last time I saw winds like this I know that some folks you know never want to leave their homes because you know it's their it's their home it's where they live they love their place your advice I would advise them to leave the area Evacuate the area uh and let us you know do our jobs that we don't want to have to uh contend with the fire and contend with you know having to deal with people who won't leave um we you know we understand the fact that this is their homes and that they are you know they're really trying to protect everything that they have but um it's it's dangerous for them and it's moving so fast I saw the firefighters Pasadena firefighters over there uh they're trying their best basically to contain it because the house is a total L and and then I saw the Embers flying and starting up another another house on fire yeah these Ember casts are our biggest challenge so the Ember casts are our biggest challenge along with the winds as you can see the houses are collapsing around us and these Ember cast are really giving us a real challenge because these Ember casts are being carried upwards of a mile to two miles away and they're starting homes on fires that we're not even in the area yet so what do you 43 we're just going to keep doing the best we can uh we have a lot of firefighters out here giving everything they have and putting everything on the line to save everyone's homes as best we can and we're going to continue to to work and do what we do any reported injuries sir uh not so far we haven't had any reported injuries that I know that I'm aware of in this division uh but uh right now um we're just focused on life and then saving property we were at the rescue of the senior citizens earlier that was oh my goodness those poor folks yes lots of people upwards of two to 300 people that were ambulatory and non-ambulatory but we were able to successfully get them out of the area and they were transferred to different senior facilities yes they were and some to the Civic Center I believe all right final thoughts for maybe some homeowners who may be watching this uh we're doing the best we can we're going to try to have you come back to your home thank you so much for all you do absolutely thank you all right thank you for speaking with us I'm going to let you go cuz I know you were busy um but as you can see as he described it these homes are collapsing and it feels extremely hot where we are we are surrounded by flames on the right on the left in front of us this entire neighborhood is devastated and again this is the eaten fire that is destroying all of these properties and it's a fire that started really small you know at around 6:30 with just about 20 acres and it quickly exploded into this and it just keeps growing and growing and we're nowhere near the hillsides we're pretty far down and it has just been those winds keep blowing those Embers and the flames and they spark up new flames and it has just been absolutely devastating I'll send it back to you guys in the studio all right well you you saying that you're surrounded by Flames makes me nervous so you too be safe with the crew out there of course G thank you so much for your reporting uh you know we want to make sure that you understand that there is now a third fire Alex you just reported this uh but I think it's important to reiterate this third fire has erupted this one is in Silmar at least 50 acres burned so far with a fast rate of spread and evacuation orders are in place for north of the 210 Freeway from Rockford to the interstate 514 freeway split lafd is also responding to this so you think about it lfd oh my goodness look at that this does look like a demonstration when you cover when you when you I played firefighter for the day with Orange County Fire for instance and they do these demonstra demonstrations to show you how quickly a home can burn and that's exactly uh what this is uh but this unfortunately is reality yeah and and uh Alex Michaels and marlot is here with special coverage on the Fox 11 News at 10 um I know some folks are losing power and they're not able to watch TV um and in case that happens to you we just want to let you know because I told people about this we also are streaming on the fox Local app all of our coverage is there for free you can watch us on your phone if you have to leave your house you can watch us there we have this live commercial free coverage of this life saving information there um so you can watch us on TV or on that app also on live now from Fox we're streaming as well um Ed lasos is live for us right now in Pacific Palisades and and Ed the it looks like the winds are getting worse winds are definitely getting worse here the fire also getting worse as it comes down that is this is swathmore and sunset it's right behind Starbucks if you're familiar with this area in the heart of the village itself that's a high-end well it was a high-end clothing store and it just lit on fire about 10 minutes ago because there are Embers blowing right across here on the other side of sunset is the the new development the Rick Caruso put in here maybe about a year or so ago Mikey swings over that way you can see all these Embers when the wind blows down and it's blowing from your screen eventually we'll get a good guess from right to left and it blows those Embers right through it looks like a sort of a chimney as it comes down across Sunset and it blew those Embers right into that clothing store as it's now fully engulfed here's a good look at those Embers coming down Mikey see them coming down through here and it's amazing that they they're blowing they're glowing they come through we moved inside the live truck for our own protection but these winds are unbelievable look at on Sunset they up there over by the US Bank building here in the village it's it's it's it's it's a fire storm a wind storm a smoke storm it's unbelievable here because if there's no visibility the power is out and then all of a sudden you hear you you hear a couple of booms and you see a building like this just roaring and it's now threatening moving across to the next side of the building the next building right over and but but also you can see how the the the intensity of the Flames here because these winds are blowing right into it the palm trees are swaying it reminds me covering some of the the tropical storms and the Hurricanes when I worked down in Florida years ago it's that type of situation the truck is swings back and forth when you get these very strong gusts almost as one of the witnesses was saying a few minutes ago it feels like an earthquake only here it's no earthquake it's just look at all these Embers blowing over this way right there there you go that's they're blowing down slothmore that is right through the inter right through the quarter there of the Rick Caruso development that he that he put together over here right off Sunset decorated for Christmas just a week or so ago now it's all dark still no uh the power shut off all the smoke detectors you hear all the beeping going off there no flames in that area the street behind that I must tell you some multi-million doll homes and the last check several of those were up in Flames as well so the fire roaring here it's moving as you can see with these flames and and the wind and the the the Embers it's really blowing now to the west and also moving it toward the ocean itself toward PCH and as it does though there are still many many buildings in the in the residential area but also in the main business area here of the village itself that the burning and that is one of them right over here it's less than a block away from G son's CVS Pharmacy and that high-end clothing store roaring out there's another store right next to it that's right now looks like it's going to go and it's it's an ember storm here these lit Embers firefighters were here a little while ago about maybe about 12 of them actually with their engines they moved a few blocks down to try to take care of some homes that were being threatened by Flames they're just moving from one location to another not much they can do everybody's just trying to probably just praying that this night ends very quickly just just to be clear so the The Villages which is Caruso's property is that actually what we're looking at burning right now or is that the villages on the side so what okay yeah yeah the villages are actually uh this is that that is on the uh South Side the fire itself you cross Sunset that's the north side we just panned over and this is right on the corner here where there's a US Bank building it's now you can't see it it's covered in Smoke right on the corner is the beginning of the villages that Co up swathmore the main entrance of the Caruso development that is not burning we have not seen any FL but on the other side of that we did see U uh uh some of the homes we're going to drive up to give you a better look right down uh sofm right down the villages we'll creep up here just stay with us here a second as we we move up we'll give you an idea I know there's some homes on the backside some of the larger homes they were burning you could see the the glow in the sky the smoke but let's see as we we come up just a little further this has actually been like a wind tunnel here blowing all those Embers and so they blow him in this direction they blow across Sunset to the South side and that unfortunately is where we've had the uh that clothing store light up on fire so there's the villages looking straight down now but the glow back there I'll get out of the way so you can see better but the glow is really some of the holes on the back side of it they are burning they are they're burning that not of a threaten threaten to The Villages themselves but several homes back there are burning and there's just no way no way to stop it at this point with these winds that are blowing certainly out of control wow yeah I mean that is just one of the most beautiful picturesque areas not only in Southern California but in the entire country um it those are like perfect streets that to me is like one of the ideal places to live um it is a close-knit community um and it is just heartbreaking to see um so many Flames look at that oh no um and and just awful uh to think about that and and to see so many images like that and Mara I just can't think about how many many different places are being impacted by this in so many different areas and how our Southern California Community is going to be impacted by this for years to come to try to rebuild um from all of this I mean on on any night if we were covering one fire that had one or two buildings down that would be a huge story for us and the fact that we are now covering at least three um uh two of which have been really destructive and a third that has potential to be um is just you know unlike any night that I can remember in 15 years of of news coverage in in here in in Southern California we've had big fires before we've had destructive fires but to have this much happening at the same time is is pretty rare it's apocalyptic uh the Palisades fire especially obviously the more damaging one at this point Point uh we've seen the loss of businesses Ed was just showing us that we've seen the loss of homes we've seen the loss of schools uh this is and you talk about the Titan neit community that Palisades is it's a small community of just about 23,000 population the high school's gone uh Elementary School's gone uh we're hearing now businesses along the PCH have been devoured by those Flames from Malibu to uh Pacific pal AES of course those Flames jumping the the PCH the Pacific Coast Highway and here's a look into Caruso's Village here you see you know the Lululemon and and so far this has been spared but all all it takes is one of those Embers and those Embers are everywhere because across the street uh that's a business I think that Ed was saying that's a clothing store that is now gone and look at the flags I mean just to give you an idea of those sustained winds um they are whipping and they they will only get worse I hate to say that but that is the reality I just look at those flags we know overnight uh the sustained winds could get up to 70 mph uh that's forecasted Adam Krueger has been watching those numbers for us it is such a devastating scene out there uh you know the best thing that we can report is so far no loss of life and that's the whole point they want to save lives before they save structures nonetheless this doesn't make this any less heartbreaking Alex Ed can you tell us is that clothing store is that the Elise Walker Clothing Store that we that that is across the street can you I don't know if you can see it from where you are or you even can tell yeah yeah you know it maybe I can't really see but I know it is the one right on the corner right on the back side of the Starbucks that is over there on on swore so I believe that it is I know it's usually the type story there's always many times a line of folks Shoppers to get inside they usually have a guard out front and it's a very high-end store beautiful clothing a lot of folks come out of there buying stuff looking very pretty they had some of the best fashions in there I'm told and now which is quickly burning up but look at the how the the Flames are being whipped by these winds that are blowing down through swinging down from the north over to the West yeah alely is a personal friend of mine and um somebody who started her business there and has um several stores in different parts of the state and the country um and is beloved in that community and has worked so hard to build a brand that is um really become iconic for that community and to see if that is indeed that store Going Up in Flames is just uh heartbreaking and I I've been in there and and know a lot of the people that work there and it's really really upsetting to watch that um and that that sentiment is you know something that is repeated in different businesses and different homes around Southern California T tonight wow yeah I'm sorry uh that you're having to deal with that personally um so many personal stories out there uh that we've been reporting on all afternoon we've been on the air since this broke out at 10:30 this morning so well over 12 hours Alex and I have been in place basically since 2:30 this afternoon commercial free and the Palisades fire continues just to wreak havoc uh in this small tight-knit community um so far the k so Village looks to be spared but as I'm seeing saying that on the right side of your screen that is part of it and I see some Flames erupting I'm not sure if that is actually the Caruso Village it was off to the right or not um we'll have to wait and see uh Rick Caruso just that actually is is not but we what we are seeing is some of the the Flames from that clothing store across of sunset is reflecting in some of the windows of the businesses here at the Village but as I look down swathmore the village itself is not burning the the the the shops are not burning here but a block over you can see the glow and the Flames especially over there look at that Mikey that is the a half a block over on the back side of the of the village the V and look at that flame the wall of fire roaring through I know there's many of the there were apartment buildings in there in condos that they've been there for decades maybe two or three stories that line that street and they are just going up in Flames as we speak uh Rick Caruso is watching our coverage and just text me um uh and he's frustrated um that he's not seeing water in the hydrants in the Palisades um which has made it difficult to fight this fire essentially um there's nothing they can do if they don't have any water and you don't see a lot of firefighters there um so far he's been lucky um but we've seen similar complaints from other parts of Pacific Palisades and certain areas where they essentially just ran out of water and then the firefighters had to leave um so I don't know exactly what's going on with that um hopefully that problem can be fixed and this property can be spared um but uh I know that he's not the only one that has been asking questions about that um and and Mr Caruso we hope your property is okay tonight I'm just devastating I'm sure and anxious everybody watching this yeah absolutely and we did pose that question earlier to lafd about resources in terms of personnel and also water resources and it didn't seem to be a problem um but of course uh you know we're hearing from people that tell a different story so we'll have to follow up there this is our crew this is a live picture from Ed lasos and his photographer uh who is tonight Mike armo Mike armo I apologize Mike of course it's Mike uh behind the wheel uh taking us through really the heart of the village here in Pacific Palisades another uh business that is in engulfed in flames tonight we've seen this time and time again not just businesses we've seen it with schools Palisades charter high on fire the Palisades Elementary School on fire as well and let let's talk about um uh the third fire that is now burning in Southern California the silar fire this is uh our first look at that um this is some video coming in from the citizen app and you get a sense for the first time we've seen of the images of what it looks like in Silmar right now and you also get a sense of how close this fire is burning to the freeway uh which is why um the evacuation zone for this goes uh north of the 210 Freeway from Rockford to the interstate 514 split um and you think about that area all the homes uh and the businesses that are in that particular area going all the way to the freeway um and so that is an area of concern tonight as well uh now we're back in uh the west side of Los Angeles looking at the Palisades fire um which is well over 3,000 Acres burned um and no end in sight and we are in the midst of some of the worst winds right now um and uh Mara with a lot of this it basically like there's not a lot that firefighters can do no um they they've told us as we've reported that they triage the situation it's like trying to fight a tornado how do you do that uh when a tornado's on fire you let it you let it basically explode and then you have to just go back and uh do what you can in the postfire fight so it's one of those situations um with these devastating winds and this was uh deemed by the National Weather Service a rare event they call it a a PDS event which is a particularly dangerous situation those are very rare and that's what this is deemed as uh and so we've dealt with this ironically um two more times in the last few months so three I believe it's three times in three months because we had beginning in November we had the mountain fire in Ventura County that was devastating almost 20,000 acres and almost 250 structures destroyed and then December 9th the Franklin fire adjacent to the Palisades uh Palisades uh that one broke out that wasn't as devastating we were on the air with that until the we hours of the morning 20 structures destroyed and here we are on January the 7th into the new year what a way to start the new year in the Palisades yes indeed um and by the way uh if you're wondering where is LA mayor Karen bass uh she's been in Ghana uh so she's apparently on her way back that's why we have not seen her on the scene we saw Governor Nome at the scene earlier we know that President Biden uh happens to be in town um but we have not seen him on camera with all of this um and so we expect to hear more from officials at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning uh in the meantime a whole lot could happen between now and then um and we are going to stay on the air for at least the next hour um continuing our coverage usually uh this is the time of night where we transition over to our show called good night La um tonight is not a good night in LA and uh we are just going to be continuing our coverage uh for Fox 11 Los Angeles um this is one of the uh the worst nights that we have seen a long time so as we approach uh the top of the hour and the end of this hour we're going to do a bit of a a reset and people can get uh caught up on what they may have missed tonight we are covering Three Fires the Palisades fire the eaten fire in Altadena and now the Silmar fire all of that coverage will continue at the top of the hour when we typically bring you good night La that coverage continues in just moments stay with us this home seems like it's being considered a loss there are so many homes that are in danger how many more horses do you have we have a couple we just let loose over there we're trying to get as many as we can out there's 12 yeah I know they're pretty wired up when the wind's blowing Anders they don't really know what to do everyone out all right I always have a bag packed sunset's already backed up and people are fighting and the only access Ingress and egress is Tasco Canyon and Sunset Boulevard we just watched the last one on that Terrace burn to the ground good good evening Welcome to our continuing coverage of the Fox 11 News of the massive firefight across Southern California I'm Alex Michaelson and I'm marot tez here for Christine Divine tonight uh the fast moving Pacific Palisades fire it has burned uh about 3,000 Acres we can tell you that it's burned more than that that 2921 Acres acreage number that has been uh on the books for a few hours now we're waiting for new numbers from calire thousands of people have evacuated the fire is fueled by strong Santa Ana winds uh by midafternoon it had grown rapidly threatening over 13,000 structures including more than 10,000 homes containment is at 0% mandatory evacuations cover much of the area with nearby Malibu now issuing warnings as well firefighters began using those air tankers and helicopters to battle the Flames but both are grounded tonight because of the wind evacuation routes they were jammed some residents abandoning cars I know we have some images of that uh Palisades Charter High School has been hit hard its Fields its grounds have been destroyed fire started this morning near Pedra marada and Monta Hermosa drives officials warned worsening winds overnight could spread the fire further smoke advisories are in effect residents are urged to stay indoors we still don't know what caused the fire mandatory evacuation Zone has expanded to the East and to the north North the map from LA City fire shows the scope of evacuation orders that remain in effect for areas north to mahand Road East of kenter Road and south of Pacific Coast Highway Pacific Coast Highway is closed from Santa Monica's McLure tunnel to toena Canyon with LAPD managing traffic residents are urged to turn off power before leaving and those near the evacuation Zone should prepare a go bag and stay informed through lafd alerts and local newscast of course the Westwood recreation center is open as an evacuation and overnight shelter accommodating small animals that is located at 1350 South ofovv Boulevard large animals can be taking the LA Equestrian Center which is in Burbank we do have live team coverage meteorologist Adam Krueger he's watching those winds and those speeds Fox 11 Gina Silva she's on the eaten fire in Altadena Ed lasos has reaction from devastated homeowners in Pacific Palisades and you are staying inside that live truck now out of your own uh concerned for your own safety yeah yeah very much so because of the winds blowing like crazy and also the the lit Embers blowing right across the sea a storm of Embers we are in the heart of the Palisades Mikey will give you a look sunset here at the corner of swore to the right that is the back area of the village that's the Rick Caruso development the development itself not burning but homes on the backside are burning there several apartment buildings condo buildings been over there for decades maybe from since the 1960s 7s with a tree line Street Going Up in Flames nothing you could do all the Embers blowing with these strong winds blowing to the South if you will the Southwest blowing toward PCH across Sunset Mikey will give you a look right across if you're familiar with this area you've got Starbucks the main section here at swathmore and sunset right in the heart of the very heart of the Palisades itself there's a trash bin that is actually on fire in a little park right in front of us and then beyond that in the background is a high-end clothing store and the store right next to it two businesses burning right down right down to the ground behind those two businesses if you're familiar with swathmore there are about two or three other very popular restaurants in this area a yogurt shop and some nice other Italian restaurants those we were just down there burnt right down to the ground CVS the pharmacy on the other side still standing and on the far side of the street Gilson's that is still up not damaged but the park here is burning there's a large tree down in the park because that's also another problem besides the fire situation here you've got trees huge limbs that are falling down huge trees that have come down in this area not to mention all the power lines but the best part of that is a lot of the power I would say all the power here is really shut down but again fire command telling us be very careful of any lines you might come across because you never know if they are activated or not but look at that that big Fireball roaring through there and it's interesting see there's a guy with with a SUV it it's amazing to me a lot of folks have been coming around here stopping coming out with their cell phones taking pictures you would think this would be the last place in the world you'd want to be putting yourself in this kind of danger we had about six fire engines right here at this corner uh maybe about 15 minutes ago they have now moved down Sunset have moved East down Sunset toward uh uh well I guess toward chaga in that area the sea there was reports that some homes in that area might also be taking on some Flames but you could see in this area in the heart of the Palisades it is very much out of control back over here to the right on the north side of sunset more of that fire that wall of flames that is roaring down on the other side there is a the 76 gas station you're familiar with that the Shell station and those are a street with just several apartment buildings homes as well up on the backside of the Caruso development they are burning the development itself which has been a Showcase of the The Village here the last couple of years is still still still okay still no damage on that although a lot of the fire alarms are going but look at the intensity of those flames and the wind that is just whipping those flames blowing it and the biggest problem here are those Embers blowing around starting start fire spot fire after spot fire and there's no way that the firefighters can keep up with that as the situation here in the heart of the Palisades is is very very dire at lasos reporting live in the heart of it in the Palisades thank you very very much for that and it'll be interesting um you know it's interesting what they're choosing to focus on and what they're choosing not to uh in terms of where deploying their resources meanwhile there's the Hurst fire in Silmar uh which is now at at least 100 acres um you're looking at pictures right now from the citizen app you see how close it is getting to the uh potential freeway there as well uh there are mandatory evacuations underway there um as we speak yeah so that has been named officially the Hearst fire we were calling it The Silmar fire now it's officially the Hearst fire we have the eaten fire that's burning in Altadena we want to get to that scene that's where Gina Silva she's been watching uh several homes burn there sadly Gina and it looks like more are completely engulfed yeah completely engulfed we are watching all of these homes on Delray Avenue and Woodland Road in Pasadena go up in Flames they are complete loss we had Pasadena police officers driving down the street you know telling all of the people in the community those who are left and there are some people who are still here to evacuate to leave immediately it's an order but there's a gentleman down the street who refuses to leave he just does not want to leave his house but you can see
