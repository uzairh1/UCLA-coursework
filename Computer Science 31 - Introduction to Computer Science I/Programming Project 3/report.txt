a. 

A few notable obstacles I overcame were accumulating values correctly for a *sequence* of numbers and letters, like "E1E1E1" or "E1M1S1". Another notable obstacle was not being able to use global variables and getting the latter functions to work without them.

b. 

For isValidRingString:
I check whether the string is empty, whether the first letter is not an E, M, or S, and if the next character is not one in the set E, M, S, 0-9. If any of these are true for a given ring string, I return false. 

Entering the first for loop, I set char c equal to ringstring.at(0) and ensure the next character is a digit (if not, I return false). Before entering the second for loop, I initialize a temp variable that will hold the values of eMinutes, sMinutes, and mMinutes as they accumulate. char c keeps track of the last letter seen and allows temp to be added to eMinutes, mMinutes, or sMinutes appropriately. Finally, I ensure none of eMinutes, mMinutes, or sMinutes exceeds 999.

For the rest of the program:

Similar logic to isValidRingString is implemented in the next three functions so they can return the number of exercise, stand, or move minutes. The last three functions use the values returned from totalMoveMinutes, totalStandMinutes, and totalExerciseMinutes and compare them against the provided goal.

c. 

isValidRingString("E5") - all kind values not present
isValidRingString("E1E1E1") - a sequence of numbers and letters
isValidRingString("baba") - invalid characters
isValidRingString("E1000M1000S1") - values exceeding 999
isValidRingString("E0") - total minutes 0
isValidRingString("E00011") - leading zeros
isValidRingString("E10S") - no value for standing minutes
isValidRingString("         E6") - leading whitespace
isValidRingString("E6           ") - trailing whitespace
isValidRingString("E6 S6") - space between E6 and S6
isValidRingString("") - empty string
totalMoveMinutes("E1M1S1") - should return 1
totalMoveMinutes("   E1M1S1") - invalid ring string
totalExerciseMinutes("E1M1S1") - should return 1
totalExerciseMinutes("   E1M1S1") - invalid ring string
totalStandMinutes("E1M1S1") - should return 1
totalStandMinutes("   E1M1S1") - invalid ring string
metMoveGoal("E1M1S1", 1) - should return false
metMoveGoal("E1M1S1", 0) - should return true
metMoveGoal("   E1M1S1", 0) - invalid ring string - should return false
metMoveGoal("E1M1S1", -1) - negative goal - should return false
metStandGoal("E1M1S1", 1) - should return false
metStandGoal("E1M1S1", 0) - should return true
metStandGoal("   E1M1S1", 0) - invalid ring string - should return false
metStandGoal("E1M1S1", -1) - negative goal - should return false
metExerciseGoal("E1M1S1", 1) should return false
metExerciseGoal("E1M1S1", 0) - should return true
metExerciseGoal("   E1M1S1", 0) - invalid ring string - should return false
metExerciseGoal("E1M1S1", -1) - negative goal - should return false

NOTE: My code fails the test case assert(isValidRingString("M100E") == false).
