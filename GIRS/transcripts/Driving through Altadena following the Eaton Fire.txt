Thank you. We will come back to you shortly. Right now we want to go out to our Annette Arreola driving around. We believe the Eaton fire area. And, Annette, give us your latest location and what you've been seeing so far today. Hey, good afternoon to you, Jonathan and Kathy. Hello everybody. You know, right now we are on Calaveras Street just east of Lake Avenue. And let me tell you, the more we drive around, it's sad. There is no other way to put this entire chunks of this city are in ruins. Let's go ahead and show you what we're seeing here. This is the Aldi grocery store right off of Lake and Calaveras. It's gone. It's completely gone. Just like so many other businesses. This is Charles Elliott Magnet school. I was talking to Enrique moments ago, and he goes, oh, it looks like the school may have survived because we were on Lake. Once we turned onto Calaveras, this is what we saw. It is charred. A good chunk of it is gone. Other parts survived. We've been out here since very, very early Wednesday morning and it is heartbreaking to see the vehicles that were left parked out on the street that are now completely charred. And of course, the homes, the structures now the city of Altadena says that by aerial images, they suspect that there are over 7000 homes structures that have been damaged or destroyed by the Eaton fire. Now, right now, there are so many people that are trying to get in, trying to see exactly what is left of their neighborhood, what is left of their community. The National Guard is also out here, stationed along several streets on Lake Avenue. Because Lake Avenue is one of those main arteries here in the city of Altadena, there is restricted access because they are trying to prevent any looting from happening. We have had to go through several checkpoints as media as well, and all we are seeing right now, we're seeing police, law enforcement, we are seeing Southern California Edison, we're seeing utility companies out here. Of course, media, but very little, very little of in terms of residents, vehicles, personal vehicles driving around the city. Again, this area is still heavily restricted because if you are looking at these images, you are aware that this is also a very dangerous situation for anybody just coming o here. There are downed power lines, you know, gas lines. There is a lot of debris still blocking a lot of these streets here in the city of Altadena. And they are still trying to make sure that everyone stays safe. We do know that there is going to be a virtual meeting at 4:00 in the afternoon with fire officials giving residents latest information in terms of numbers, evacuations and resources that they can start tapping into. But by God, this is this is one of the worst areas that I have ever seen it. It looks like a bomb went off along with riots, mudflows and mudflows and a fire all just put together. It really, really is a catastrophic situation. And when residents start coming back and trying to assess the damage, it's going to be a double whammy. It's going to be an emotional toll. And then moving on to a financial toll, really, because how do you start picking up the pieces is really going to be another question that they're going to have to face very soon. But again, it's entire chunks of this community that are now gone. And we have been through several streets here in the city, and we're still seeing the ground is very hot. It's still scorching. We see smoke billowing from a lot of these places that have burned down. Right now we are on Lake Avenue and Mariposa Street, and you can see there, you know, we have crews working down on utility lines again, trying to see how quickly they can get some of these services restored. So once people residents are given the okay to come on in, they can do so and have something to work with. We were out here, I was out here on Thursday and I needed to use the restroom. About 12 13 hours into the shif, and there wasn't a place to turn to. It was a really dire situation. So you really start thinking about the people that actually live here and want to come here and what services are up and running for them. I ran into a few folks whose homes were were intact, thank goodness, and they said, we would love to let you in and use and use our restroom, but there is no running water. So then there is that other issue that they have to deal with right now that a lot of folks that have been affected, both in Altadena and Pasadena, have to drink bottled water right now, they are not they they are being urged to not use their tap water because of all the particles and contaminants. Due to the Eaton fire. Now we are coming into an area here. This is Ganesha Avenue and Ganesha and Mariposa. We were out here early Wednesday morning and let me tell you that this was a frightening scene. I call it the circle of fire. It was like a ring of fire because as we drove in this entire perimeter here was up in flames. And you can see none of these houses survived. Here. It is beyond devastation. We didn't know what we were going to find. We came back the next day and we actually weren't able to identify it. If it was the only reason we were able to, to find out where we were was because we memorized the streets, the streets and some of the addresses here. And that is how we knew that we were back at that same spot where this ring of fire was just engulfing everything along its path. So again, you know, curfew is still in place 6 p.m. Through 6 a.m. As we were making our way up north through Lake Avenue, there were several people waiting in line trying to see if the National Guard would let them in. And the other thing that we did see were, were several folks that were handing out gallons of water. They were handing out toilet paper. They were holding up signs saying supplies here. So again, this is a community that is that is hurting. But through that hurt and pain are definitely coming together in solidarity and pulling their own resources together to help one another, which was incredible to see. So this is what is Altadena at the moment. Jonathan and Kathy and Annette, as you drive through, it's not lost on us that so many homes were damaged and destroyed, but people lost their lives here. And when the people who lived there come back, they're going to have to rebuild. They're going to need emotional support, psychological support in some cases, financial, as you said, everyone has to come together. But I can't even wrap my head around the psychology of what it's going to be like to have your whole town this beautiful neighborhood, beautiful, gone, and such a rich community there. And what's striking Kathy and Annette is that Annette, you haven't stopped moving in the 5 or 6 minutes since we first went out to you, and we have not stopped seeing the devastation. I mean, this really is giving us a better scope of just the sheer devastation that happened there in the Eaton fire goes on. It just never stops. It goes on and it goes on. It does. It does not stop. As a matter of fact, this is one of the intersections that we were at Mendocino and Mar Vista. I don't know if we can show you the left hand side of, of the street here. If we'd have to do a U-turn. Photographer Jeff Scharping and I were here Wednesday morning. That house in the corner was fully engulfed. We were out here for quite some time. Then firefighters started arriving and they were able to save the four homes. But right next to that corner house, that one was a goner. They said, now our efforts is to try to save the four homes next to it. And they did. And they were pouring every resource that they could into this. But spot fires were coming up so incredibly quickly that they just could not get ahead of those. One of the areas that also impacted was the golf course, Altadena Golf course. You know, I went there for one of Darsha Philips baby showers years ago. And as I was driving back home once I was off my shift, I said, this looks familiar. I've I've been here before. And it was recognizable. Unrecognizable. But I but I knew because of the parking lot or something that just clicked a memory in my brain. And I said, I've been here. And yeah, I had and like I said, this is a completely different town. Wednesday morning as we were talking to firefighters, you know, as they were trying to also tackle the blaze, they told me that they had to go because right around the corner, there were people that were trapped that couldn't get out. So it makes you wonder whether it was at that location where, you know, we had some some people that passed away, who knows when we were back here on Thursday morning, law enforcement, we had sheriff's deputies telling us that we couldn't go in through certain areas because they were now taped off. As crime scenes are considered crime scenes because of the folks that unfortunately died during the fire. So right now I know that we are backing up. We turned on to Calaveras Street again, and you can see here, I don't know if you guys can appreciate this, but there's a downed tree, so we can't go past this. And this is precisely why, again, officials, local, state, federal officials, law enforcement, fire agencies really want to keep these streets clear from from cars, from other vehicles, because it's a hazard. It's a hazard for everybody. Everybody who who who is through here. I can also tell you that on Thursday morning, while we were going live before the sun came up, there was a vehicle that was coming at a considerable speed, and we were trying to flag it down because not only was it coming at us, it was going straight for some downed power lines and power poles. So it was going to crash. And again, you know, as we continue to drive, this is more of what you will see. Jonathan, Jonathan and Kathy will send it back to you. No, absolutely. Annette, thank you for that. Very sobering look at the Altadena area on this Saturday afternoon. It's just I'm without words, Kathy. I know, and I just wanted to mention that there's an unincorporated area there in Altadena too, that people have small barns, their sort of backyard barns with animals, chickens, horses. And it's much like the rancho in Burbank that they ride their horses in, that you might be walking down the street and you see someone coming with a horse. So there's there are a lot of animals. And the community cares about those animals. Oh, absolutely. It's a it's a fabric of that part of the, you know, the community. And I'm just so floored by these images, a very effective use of our, of our technology here that we're able to drive around and really show you the scope of this, because a lot of people, Kathy, too, they're still wondering, is my house still there? Were we one of the lucky ones?
