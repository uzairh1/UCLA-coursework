I heard some people say there were houses that cost upwards of $10 million but there were also cases of houses that had their insurance policies canceled due to fire risk.  It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.\nI had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."}
