<h1>Homework 6</h1>

<h2>Due Tuesday, December 3, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Turn in your homework via the course web page as an updated version of the <tt>hw6.py</tt> file that I have provided.

<h3>Make sure that the file can be executed without any syntax or other errors into the Python interpreter; otherwise you will get a 0 on the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS30 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.  You can list that as a comment at the top of the <tt>hw6.py</tt> file.</h3>

<h3>The Assignment</h3>

This assignment will give you practice with loops. <b>Here are the rules you must follow:</b>

<ol>
	<li>You may not use either recursion or functions that take
		other functions as arguments (such as <tt>map</tt> and <tt>filter</tt>).  Instead, <b>your functions should only use loops.</b><p></p></li>

	<li>Do not use any function from Python libraries.  Do not use any built-in functions of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  Do not use any language features of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  If in doubt, ask!<p></p></li>

    <li>Some problems have additional rules for you to follow.  Pay close attention to them.<p></li>

	<li>Test your code as usual, with the functions in <tt>hw6test.py</tt>.<p></li>
</ol>

The file <tt>hw6.py</tt> is empty.  You should write your functions there.  <b>Make sure to use exactly the same function names as specified below, or you will get no credit.</b>

<ol type="a">

<li>Implement a function <tt>halveEvens</tt>, which takes a list <tt>l</tt> of integers and returns a list that is identical to <tt>l</tt> except that all odd integers have been removed and all even integers have been halved.  For example, <tt>halveEvens([10,21,32,42,55])</tt> returns <tt>[5, 16, 21]</tt>.<p></p></li>

<li>Implement a function <tt>splitEveryOther</tt> that takes a list <tt>l</tt> and returns a list of two lists that together contain the elements of the original list in an "every other" fashion.  For example, <tt>splitEveryOther([1, 4, 23, 3, 8])</tt> returns <tt>[[1, 23, 8], [4, 3]]</tt>. <b>Important Rule: You are not allowed to use the slicing operation on lists.</b><p></p></li>

<li>Implement a function <tt>isSorted</tt>, which takes a list of integers and returns <tt>True</tt> if the list is in sorted order from least to greatest and <tt>False</tt> otherwise.  Duplicate elements are allowed.  For example, <tt>isSorted([1, 3, 3, 7])</tt> returns <tt>True</tt> while <tt>isSorted([1, 3, 7, 3])</tt> returns <tt>False</tt>.<p></p></li>

<li>In mathematics, the <i>dot product</i> of two vectors of numbers &lt;a1,a2,...,aN&gt; and &lt;b1,b2,...,bN&gt; is defined as a1*b1 + a2*b2 + ... + aN*bN. Implement a function <tt>dotProduct</tt> that computes the dot product of two vectors, where Python lists are used to represent the vectors. For example, <tt>dotProduct([1,2,3], [4,5,6])</tt> returns <tt>32</tt> (since 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32). You may assume that the two argument lists have the same length.<p></li>


<li> Re-implement the <tt>negate</tt> function from Homework 5, which produces the color negative of an image.  But now instead of a map within a map, you'll need to use a loop within a loop!  You can assume the same representation of images that we used in that homework: a list of lists of dictionaries.  <b>Important Rule: The original list of lists of dictionaries should not be modified at all!</b><p></li>


<li>Implement a function <tt>toDigitList</tt> that takes a positive integer <tt>n</tt> and returns a list of its digits, in order.  For example, <tt>toDigitList(403)</tt> returns <tt>[4, 0, 3]</tt>.  <b>Important Rule: You may not convert any numbers to strings, or use any string operations of Python.</b>  <i>Hint: Iteratively determine the digits from right to left in the number.  The modulo operator <tt>%</tt> and integer division  operator <tt>//</tt> will come in handy.</i><p></li>

<li>Consider the process of taking a positive integer <tt>n</tt>, summing its digits, then
    summing the digits of the number derived from it, etc., until the remaining
    number has only one digit. The digit obtained is called the <i>digital root</i> of
    <tt>n</tt>, and the number of sums required to obtain a single digit from a number <tt>n</tt> is
    called the <i>additive persistence</i> of <tt>n</tt>.

    <p>For example, 9879 has a digital root of 6 since 9+8+7+9 = 33 and 3+3 = 6.  Since
    two sets of digits were summed in this process, the additive persistence of 9879 is 2.

    <p>Implement a function <tt>digitalRootAndPersistence</tt> that takes a positive integer <tt>n</tt> and returns both its digital
    root and its additive persistence, represented as a dictionary with keys <tt>"root"</tt> and <tt>"persistence"</tt>.  For example, <tt>digitalRootAndPersistence(9879)</tt> returns
    <tt>{"root": 6, "persistence": 2}</tt>.  <i>Note: You may use Python's built-in <tt>sum</tt> function, which sums the elements of
    a list of numbers, and the <tt>toDigitList</tt> function that you defined above will also be useful.</i></li>
</ol>
