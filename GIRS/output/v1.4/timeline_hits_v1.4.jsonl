Those 1st 2 days the Black MASS was fueling the fires. ( Speculation on this sentence of course ) Keep buying them Flame Throwing EV cars. Possible cause...

Then in September 16, 2008 Bubble Burst... in 2009 I had a Social Studies Class and the Professor Who Bashed on George W. Bush for not sending Help immediately, to Katrina. While he approved immediate help for the San Diego Community. The Professor claimed President Bush was Ra4ci5t, for \"helping San Diego a predominantly {White ( his word.: not saying Caucasian ) }. While Louisiana New Orleans community getting Assistants 4 to 5 Days from when Floods started.. I Raised my hand to when he Identified Bush as R***st. He said you what's on your mind. I said your talking about 2 different scenarios. Katrina was the Largest Hurricane at the Time, and winds 100 mph with 150 mph gusts,,, The Hurricane was moving slowly, traveling North East. In those Flooded Conditions, First responders Firemen, police couldn't help their own Families, let alone their Community. People were in the Attics and Roofs of their homes, for 7 days when News choppers from other states, because the winds tipped over or destroyed, after hurricane passed. I mentioned Big Rigs tip over at 60 mph, and the Hurricane still traveling thru states surrounding Louisiana. Big Rigs from FEMA would not make to Football Stadium 10 to 25 miles away from Flooded Communities. Flood Victims were not going to Swim in Murky Waters for 10 to 25 miles. In San Diego the Communities Packed their Vehicles and were able to DRIVE to the Football Stadium. within 4 hours for 54,000 + people to commute the Winds were not as bad .

I heard some people say there were houses that cost upwards of $10 million but there were also cases of houses that had their insurance policies canceled due to fire risk.  It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.\nI had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."}

County ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION that was first set off in a small, negligently mismanaged, North Pasadena neighborhood called Eaton Canyon.\r\n\r\nWhy did the government functionally cause the fringe neighborhood of Altadena to burn to the ground?  There remained just too many housing units there that continued to qualify for the cheapest property tax rates as mandated by the State of California's 1978 Proposition 13!  In one fell, who-could'a thunkit swoop and as a consequence of the ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION, more than 2/3rds of those Proposition 13-qualifying homes have burned down or otherwise unrecoverably been damaged. \r\n\r\nWhen homeowners rebuild, the State of California -- in backstabbing fashion -- will declare all Prop' 13 covered fire rebuilds to ALL be NEW STRUCTURES.  This means all new tax-standards, and that Prop' 13's 1978 tax break has suddenly become functionally extinct.  All this is because the Satanic threesome of the State, the County, and the City of Pasadena conspired to ignore their fire-abatement duties, leading to the wholesale burn out of all them tax-avoiding property-owners.\r\n\r\nPasadena is also going to make a grab at incorporating Altadena into Pasadena as a coopted tax-base.  That's the major reason it cooperated so completely with this community burn-out conspiracy.  With all them condemned properties being wholly unlivable, the former residents of those homes will now be former voters of Altadena.  This will make it so much cheaper for the City of Pasadena to bribe-out the remaining residents to sell cheap to the City's incorporation process."}

All of the family homes that were in families for generations when it was still affordable to buy a beautiful home. I can see exactly where people get the wrong idea when they see the value of a house. My father in law bought his house in Washington State in the late 90s for like $90,000. Because of the area and the neighborhood they built around it, it’s value is closer to $500,000 now. His property taxes have gone up so much over the years, my father in law is an amazing person. He’s a master carpenter who has worked his butt off doing it for almost 50 years! We are in no way rich, money wise. Unfortunately his job doesn’t offer any sort of retirement, he’s 66 years old now and still works so hard. Those are the kind of people and families I’m truly devastated for.

Instead of strengthening frontline defenses, resources are being diverted elsewhere.

Those who got away with your life, repent and compare your life, ideals and thought process to the commandments of God, do they line up? If there is no God, there is no such thing as human rights and good or evil is only subjective. Why? Because there has to be a standard beyond oneself and humanity to be  considered objective otherwise the same government who said it was illegal and punishable by death for people with dark brown pigmentation to learn to read and write where right. If there is no God when the Catholics of the dark ages killed people who had a bible in their possession to cross reference the lies they were told by the church , they weren't wrong. If there is no God, Hitler was simply trying to make the world a better place. If there is no God, the first and second law of thermodynamics is fodder (which certainly is not daft but defacto) If there is no God,  nothing can make everything. If there is no God,  the millions of people who died in the colosseums of Rome under persecution of their faith in God were just crazy and died for a lie rather than the truth by not denouncing Christ Jesus as the son of God! Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand! There is NO other book on this planet which has prophesied with 100% accuracy every single historical event that has come to pass! If you're in church now, make sure you're in a church that teaches only what is in the Bible and NOT tradition! There is only but one church in the world that has the Bible as its the final authority! There are many false churches just like there are false believers and what one man called \"Christian Atheists\" those who believe in God but live as if He doesn't exist! This is the beginning of the end , get ready because the final judgement is near! ANYONE who spends such a tremendous amount of money on a HOUSE is definitely not living a life of humility with a quiet and meek in spirit. Only the Lord knows what these people lived like to burn down their whole community. This is but a glimpse of what's going to happen when God scorched the Earth to destroy all who willed ignorance instead of truth. \n\nEcclesiastes 8:11 \"Since sentencing is not carried out speedily, the human heart is fully set to do evil.\"\n\nMalachi 4:1 \"Behold, the coming is near.

I live here and these were hurricane force winds that came when our coastal brush was at its driest after proliferating during an unusual wet year. Our infrastructure is old and was never made to support what was needed. The aircraft which usually could support and drop water and flame retardants could not fly under extreme smoke and winds up to 100 mi per hour. Some homes were old and built before codes, some tall structures caught and held the embers. It literally was the perfect storm and it highlights the nation wide issues with insurance. The whole smelt issue just makes the politicians pointing fingers look like asses. Thanks to our amazing firefighters and the family of firefighters throughout California and ajoining states, more lives have not been lost. Early warning and evacuation systems also saved lives amongst power outages. I evacuated and am alive. Mother nature is an angry woman and has no remorse for our attempts at supremacy over the environment, no matter where you live or how much money you have. We will need help rebuilding and doing so in the best way possible. Fire and wind have always been part of the natural cycle and bring renewal and life even after destruction. Support and prayers are needed along with housing, food, and clothing. We will rebuild, but hopefully do it better and with the understanding that this is going to happen again in the future ❤"}

This life has no peaceful escape.  The demons will rob and execute and lie about the events of death.    When seeking healthcare they inject me forcibly and recently brain maimed me.   It started in 2001 to 2024.   It really started before birth long ago.  \n\nDeath is good if desired.   As an atheist I have ethics and deplore suffering.  Those in power strengthen their own resolve in attacking people such as myself.  I do not bend to the authoritarian way.     In turn I view them as the opaque block.  They are stupid but have the military might and approval by formal or informal leadership.   \n\nThe strange events are murders.   Helicopters flying into planes ?  Really?  \n\nThe burning  earth from the bombs of 1999. A nuclear bomb or bombs squished and spread many nitrogen bombs.   The crystallization of the nitrogen and fuel and any Nuclear  elements in the crevices heats the shattered earth from below.

When my head is hurting I want to see them burned as I was burned.  I was hit with bombs and not paid and was sent there to the federal conference because the others are cowards.  \n\nI would like to escalate a global war against the opaque block.  But the best we can hope for is the end of life as we know it.  But many of us live in hell eternal.  That is the nature of the celestial intestines in which we reside. \n\nThe media never speaks of lithium.  Never fear the enemy.  Never trust usa healthcare if you don’t know doctor.  If the doctor is Asian or Hispanic then I would reconsider.  They like the Gestapo in judges seats do not believe in human rights.  They even inject illegal immigrants now.  They inject me a former federal bank examiner.  Or I am maimed since birth and unconscious in a dream.  \n\nI feel I am trapped in hell.  I support voluntary carte blanche exit from hell on earth.  The silver lining is the exit from hell on earth.  Many of us are made infertile and tissue from brain extracted.  The human race is monkey feces.

Claiming that the possibility of a rekindle of the New Year’s Eve as some kind of “phenomenon” is uninformed. Fires are chemistry and physics. The pyrotechnic residue from spent fireworks mixed with the ashes and charcoal of the brush sitting in direct sunlight in 90° F temps for 7 days was enough to trigger a second fire. The ruins of any fire can rekindle if the post fire environment is right for re-ignition. LAFD made the black burnt brush wet, but it dried out, and when it gets dried out from the heat and wind it breaks down and heats up. It’s called Heat of Decomposition. Remember the primary chemical ingredients in fireworks is gun powder, potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur. The mixture of these chemicals become just as flammable and explosive after they dry out as they were before they got wet. Once the dried gunpowder residue becomes hot enough it becomes a highly volatile accelerant that if reignited can worsen fire conditions in a brush fire quickly. All it takes to get the situation right for a rekindle is to raise the temperature of the fuels above Heat of Decomposition (under 300° F) to the pyrolytic temperature of smoke (above 300° F). \nWe got an old saying in the fire service:\n“Where There’s Smoke There’s Fire.”\nAuthor unknown (and probably prehistoric but definitely not a phenomenon).\n\nChief Hughes\nBattalion 1 (retired)\nChicago FD"}

Here they are, promising salvation from cosmic threats like asteroids, claiming they can transport us to Mars or beyond. Yet, as they boast of their technological prowess, the Earth burns beneath their feet. California is engulfed in flames, Los Angeles suffocates under a darkened sky, and the forests, once vibrant with life, are reduced to ash. What do they offer in this moment of crisis? Not humility, not repentance, not stewardship of the Earth entrusted to them, but an escape plan as if they can flee the consequences of their corruption.\n\n\nHow small they are, these so-called saviors, in the face of Allah’s creation. They marvel at the stars, forgetting that Allah is Al-Khaliq, the Creator of all things, who fashioned the heavens and the Earth with perfect balance. They speak of terraforming Mars, yet they cannot even protect the Earth, the planet Allah has gifted them. They build rockets to escape asteroids, yet they cannot stop the fires they themselves have ignited through greed and neglect. What is the strength of man compared to the power of the One who commands the winds, the oceans, and the mountains? Truly, “And they plan, but Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners” (Quran 8:30).\n\n\nTheir arrogance blinds them to their own fragility. A single spark can ignite a wildfire that consumes entire cities, and yet they think they can conquer the stars. The Earth groans under the weight of their corruption, for Allah has warned, “Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned” (Quran 30:41). Instead of turning back to the One who holds the universe in His grasp, they dream of escaping His dominion, forgetting that there is no refuge except with Him.\n\n\nLet them look to the fires in California, to the hurricanes, to the floods, and understand their weakness. Let them see the signs of Allah’s power and remember their responsibility as stewards of this Earth. For no technology, no rocket, no escape plan can save them from the consequences of ignoring the One who created them. It is not Mars that will save humanity; it is humility, repentance, and submission to the will of Allah."}

I had stayed up a little bit too late the night before it was also exhausted emotionally from the Palisades fire so I didn't get to watch the Eaton fire as much as I would have liked to especially because I got called into work for early the next day but holy crap it was scary. And then I think the scary star was when I woke up on Wednesday in Burbank and saw smoke from the Eaton fire just blooming over the southern from my home in Burbank. I looked outside the window and the little part of sky I could see was so dark blue I had to ask myself if there was a mountain that I could see out that window but no there wasn't. I stepped out my front door looked to the south and it was the scariest thing I think I've seen in my life and I've seen the beginnings of a tornado. It was something so scary like a severe thunderstorm color clouds in the sky with the sun behind it, looking like absolute hell on earth. It was quite freaked out I said a lot of profanities over the course of the half hour before I left for where I work in downtown Burbank. It got scarier as I went over the bridge that crosses the railroad tracks and the freeway and it was still incredibly windy. And then at work that day, The people who come 7 days a week for breakfast and have the entire 7 months I've worked at this restaurant, We started to get freaked out like if we don't see the regulars we know something's wrong. Luckily we saw the regulars but we did see very few people the rest of the day. It was like the longest 8-hour shift of my life, especially because we had no obstructions and we could see out the windows to the west so not only could we see the Eaton fire smoke looming over us we could also see the Palisades fire about 16 miles in the distance. We stood there and not only did we watch it involve over the day We could actively see the smoke moving. It was hellish and I'm so glad that I wasn't even anywhere near and evacuation zone. I think it was the next day Thursday at work or maybe Friday when everybody got the falls alarm during the Kenneth fire and I freaked out because downtown Burbank is on the other side of the mountains from mandatory evacuation zones from the Eaton fire. It also confused me because I had become aware of the Kenneth fire maybe an hour or two for my shift when it broke out, and I  had driven East to work maybe 15 minutes before and saw nothing on the mountains. A coworker told me it was a mandatory evacuation order and I truly believe that the fire had jumped La Cañada, going up the east slope of the mountain and was now creeping down at the west side of the mountain towards downtown burbank. I'm from the Midwest so I'm not very familiar with fires but I had watched the notifications as the Palisades fire grew 10x times in 20 minutes. \n\nThe alert came again and it was the note to disregard the previous alarm. An EAS tone going out to all 200 people in the big vast store is drawing as hell and when you finally have calmed yourself down hearing it again will flip you out."}

All those homes and families were already there since I was 4 or 5 years old.  Back then we knew some celebs lived along the beach like Cary Grant, Bing Crosby and Barbara Stanwyck.  We weren't jealous or envious of them.  We had a game trying to guess who lived in which house.  Or who was that washing their car parked in front of their garage?  But we also knew regular people lived there too.  \n\nIt was the Rivera of Southern California.  My mom's favorite thing was to have fresh Lobster Tails at one of the great seafood restaurants along the way.  One time we rented horses and rode down Topanga Canyon to the beach just to have lunch.  My parents are gone.  We did this outing frequently over the years into their mid 90's.

I THINK WE KNOW WHY NOW THANKS TO GLENN BECK FOR LETTING US ALL KNOW.\nWHAT IS THE VENCEREMOS BRIGADE?\r\n\"Well, it's a Marxist training program, directly tied to Fidel Castro's regime. Between 1969 and today, this group has sent hundreds of young Americans to Cuba.\r\nNot for a vacation. Not for cultural exchange. But for radicalization.\r\nYou don't join the Venceremos Brigade because you want to learn -- what's the emoji with the salsa dancer? That's not what that is about. It's not about good Cuban coffee.\r\nYou join because you're a confirmed Marxist Leninist. A Los Angeles police investigator testified before Congress about this group. He said, members were trained in guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and bomb making. These are not idealists. They're insurgents in training. Karen Bass, she was not just a participant. She was a leader.\r\nShe visited Cuba repeatedly, she said, every six months.\r\nWe can verify eight times. She praised Fidel Castro, the dictator of Cuba, who was imprisoning dissenters, left a legacy of poverty and fear.\r\nIn fact, this is not just her youth. She's still there. When Castro died, she was one of them who called his death a great loss to the people of Cuba. Really?\r\nA loss to the same people who risked their lives fleeing his regime, trying to get out of Cuba?\r\nThis is Karen Bass. She's the Los Angeles mayor, one of the largest cities in the United States of America.\" GLENN BECK JANUARY 2025\r\n\r\nWHAT IS BLM?\r\n\"The goals of the Black Lives Matter organization go far beyond what most people think. But they are hiding in plain sight, there for the world to see, if only we read beyond the slogans and the innocuous-sounding media accounts of the movement.\r\nThe group’s radical Marxist agenda would supplant the basic building block of society—the family—with the state and destroy the economic system that has lifted more people from poverty than any other. Black lives, and all lives, would be harmed.\r\nTheirs is a blueprint for misery, not justice. It must be rejected.\" THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION JULY 2020\r\n\r\nWHAT DID KAREN BASS DO?\r\n\"As exclusively reported by DailyMail on Friday, a damning leaked memo has revealed that Bass demanded the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) cut an extra $49 million from its budget just one week before the wildfires broke out.\r\nThe demand was in addition to $17.6 million in cuts already included in the mayor's latest budget. The extra cuts would have shut down 16 LA fire stations and crippled the department's ability to respond to emergencies, according to the Daily Mail report.\r\nThe damning memo is dated January 6, just one day before the devastating Palisades Fire broke out.\" REDSTATE 1/10/2025"}

Absolutely everything down to rubble melts aluminum car rims. If you notice there’s not a single fridge nothing standing it looks like a Nuke hit it. Ever since the fire here in 2017 and 2019 most of the fires are all behaving the same way and to melt aluminum you can’t do that in a normal forest fire. It has to be in a forge a closed heating system to get up to like 2400° so they’re saying that it was that hot. We could see all the shit melted, but so many blue trash cans that are plastic did not get destroyed just like the fires here the paradise fires the Maui fires and tell me why every tree and bush out in front of housesare still standing with all their leaves and shit on there so these fires were getting hit with can melt aluminum, but can’t burn leaves on a tree?!? Yeah I’m not buying it. This was no regular forest fire. I will gladly wear my tinfoil hat and say this with confidence. I think there’s multiple reasons why they wanted to get rid of that part of California it possibly could’ve been another country and their new type of weaponry or it could’ve been the globalist doing a kind of false flag event shit this day and age I wouldn’t be surprised if people that are guilty like P Diddy needed to get rid of a bunch of evidence and it’s a great way to fill up a bunch of tunnels underground leading from house to house It would be really easy to just fill those in after this type of event and any evidence that isn’t a leaf or a tree has now been incinerated…. And you know the mega rich people would definitely love to depopulate the same time. They pull off some event like this get ready for the next sickness and lockdowns alongside world conflict. 2025 is getting off to a hell of a start.

All these scumbags are still selling September 11 & Bin Laden at face value. Mid East Wars, Shootings. \nhere’s a lesson on WIND provided by TRUTJ TO POWER NUMBER 1! Miles W Mathis.\n\n[Added January 18, 2025: But back to the winds. As I said, and as you know, everyone on both sides is pushing 100mph Santa Ana winds to explain this, including the weather expert Bill Burr. One problem: there is no such thing. Look it up if you don't believe me. Start with the Beaufort Scale, where you will learn that 100mph winds are normally only found in cyclones, like hurricanes and tornados. Strong Santa Ana winds never hit 100 or even 50. They rarely gust to 40mph, but the ones in LA last week were only about 25. I know because I checked. It is quite easy to do these days, just go to one of the many weather channels and type in the zip code. 25mph is a strong wind, and I guess\n \nreally stupid people could mistake it for a 100mph wind, supposing they had never been anywhere near a 100mph wind. To give you a comparison, a gale is defined as about 40-45mph, and that can knock you over and cause 25ft waves at sea. A strong gale is 45-55mph, and that can tear shingles off your house. That wasn't happening in LA, because Santa Ana winds never hit strong gale or Beaufort 9. Beaufort 10 is full gale or storm, with winds up to 63mph. As it says at Wiki, this is almost never seen inland, and it will uproot trees and blow houses down. Beaufort 11 is up to 72mph, causing 50ft waves at sea. Even most sailors have never experienced this, and they don't want to. Anything above 73mph is hurricane, Beaufort 12, so the talking heads in LA are claiming way above hurricane force winds hit Palisades on Tuesday. Which is how I knew they were lying immediately.]"}

She was my best friend, and the most beautiful person in the world. I took my mother for granted that she would always be around, but she died when I was only 17-years-old. And she died in a very tragic way. Money and things they never really meant much to me, after I learned that lesson of losing my mother to the house fire. Seems in America we have become a country who only values materialism, wealth, fame, aesthetic beauty. But we don’t value anything of the things that are really important in life. Such as friends, animals, kindness, love, freedom, empathy, integrity, etcetera. And then we reward those that are greedy, selfish, self centered, famous, status in society, etcetera. I learned so much from my mother. And if I could bring her back by destroying all my possessions that I have now, I would destroy them all in a heartbeat. I guess I should feel sorry for these people that value their “things” so much. Because they will never know the happiness of having the real things that are important in our lives."}

I had stayed up a little bit too late the night before it was also exhausted emotionally from the Palisades fire so I didn't get to watch the Eaton fire as much as I would have liked to especially because I got called into work for early the next day but holy crap it was scary. And then I think the scary star was when I woke up on Wednesday in Burbank and saw smoke from the Eaton fire just blooming over the southern from my home in Burbank. I looked outside the window and the little part of sky I could see was so dark blue I had to ask myself if there was a mountain that I could see out that window but no there wasn't. I stepped out my front door looked to the south and it was the scariest thing I think I've seen in my life and I've seen the beginnings of a tornado. It was something so scary like a severe thunderstorm color clouds in the sky with the sun behind it, looking like absolute hell on earth. It was quite freaked out I said a lot of profanities over the course of the half hour before I left for where I work in downtown Burbank. It got scarier as I went over the bridge that crosses the railroad tracks and the freeway and it was still incredibly windy. And then at work that day, The people who come 7 days a week for breakfast and have the entire 7 months I've worked at this restaurant, We started to get freaked out like if we don't see the regulars we know something's wrong. Luckily we saw the regulars but we did see very few people the rest of the day. It was like the longest 8-hour shift of my life, especially because we had no obstructions and we could see out the windows to the west so not only could we see the Eaton fire smoke looming over us we could also see the Palisades fire about 16 miles in the distance. We stood there and not only did we watch it involve over the day We could actively see the smoke moving. It was hellish and I'm so glad that I wasn't even anywhere near and evacuation zone. I think it was the next day Thursday at work or maybe Friday when everybody got the falls alarm during the Kenneth fire and I freaked out because downtown Burbank is on the other side of the mountains from mandatory evacuation zones from the Eaton fire. It also confused me because I had become aware of the Kenneth fire maybe an hour or two for my shift when it broke out, and I  had driven East to work maybe 15 minutes before and saw nothing on the mountains. A coworker told me it was a mandatory evacuation order and I truly believe that the fire had jumped La Cañada, going up the east slope of the mountain and was now creeping down at the west side of the mountain towards downtown burbank. I'm from the Midwest so I'm not very familiar with fires but I had watched the notifications as the Palisades fire grew 10x times in 20 minutes. \n\nThe alert came again and it was the note to disregard the previous alarm. An EAS tone going out to all 200 people in the big vast store is drawing as hell and when you finally have calmed yourself down hearing it again will flip you out."}

All these scumbags are still selling September 11 & Bin Laden at face value. Mid East Wars, Shootings. \nhere’s a lesson on WIND provided by TRUTJ TO POWER NUMBER 1! Miles W Mathis.\n\n[Added January 18, 2025: But back to the winds. As I said, and as you know, everyone on both sides is pushing 100mph Santa Ana winds to explain this, including the weather expert Bill Burr. One problem: there is no such thing. Look it up if you don't believe me. Start with the Beaufort Scale, where you will learn that 100mph winds are normally only found in cyclones, like hurricanes and tornados. Strong Santa Ana winds never hit 100 or even 50. They rarely gust to 40mph, but the ones in LA last week were only about 25. I know because I checked. It is quite easy to do these days, just go to one of the many weather channels and type in the zip code. 25mph is a strong wind, and I guess\n \nreally stupid people could mistake it for a 100mph wind, supposing they had never been anywhere near a 100mph wind. To give you a comparison, a gale is defined as about 40-45mph, and that can knock you over and cause 25ft waves at sea. A strong gale is 45-55mph, and that can tear shingles off your house. That wasn't happening in LA, because Santa Ana winds never hit strong gale or Beaufort 9. Beaufort 10 is full gale or storm, with winds up to 63mph. As it says at Wiki, this is almost never seen inland, and it will uproot trees and blow houses down. Beaufort 11 is up to 72mph, causing 50ft waves at sea. Even most sailors have never experienced this, and they don't want to. Anything above 73mph is hurricane, Beaufort 12, so the talking heads in LA are claiming way above hurricane force winds hit Palisades on Tuesday. Which is how I knew they were lying immediately.]"}

In fact, this concept has been in the works for a long time. It revolves around creating sustainable communities that are higher in density, use resources more efficiency, and consume less energy. A critical branch of this includes more public gathering space for things such as parks and farmers markets and neighborhood amphitheaters. More transit hubs which people out of cars is also part of new communities. And local zoning ordinances will be over-ridden in order to stop Nimby-ism and exclusion. \r\n\r\nWith the destruction of entire neighbors, there are great new opportunities. New types of communities can rise from the ashes. People whose homes were destroyed might find themselves with a very tempting offer of getting a new home, built and paid for by the government, where homeowners would live in sustainable building complexes shared with other homeowners. Let’s not be afraid of this, people need to be open to Newsom’s ideas and the creative solutions that his team is forwarding. A new model of living can help us adjust to global warming while fostering a healthier and more connected and inclusive society."}

This life has no peaceful escape.  The demons will rob and execute and lie about the events of death.    When seeking healthcare they inject me forcibly and recently brain maimed me.   It started in 2001 to 2024.   It really started before birth long ago.  \n\nDeath is good if desired.   As an atheist I have ethics and deplore suffering.  Those in power strengthen their own resolve in attacking people such as myself.  I do not bend to the authoritarian way.     In turn I view them as the opaque block.  They are stupid but have the military might and approval by formal or informal leadership.   \n\nThe strange events are murders.   Helicopters flying into planes ?  Really?  \n\nThe burning  earth from the bombs of 1999. A nuclear bomb or bombs squished and spread many nitrogen bombs.

That is the nature of the celestial intestines in which we reside. \n\nThe media never speaks of lithium.  Never fear the enemy.  Never trust usa healthcare if you don’t know doctor.  If the doctor is Asian or Hispanic then I would reconsider.  They like the Gestapo in judges seats do not believe in human rights.  They even inject illegal immigrants now.  They inject me a former federal bank examiner.  Or I am maimed since birth and unconscious in a dream.  \n\nI feel I am trapped in hell.  I support voluntary carte blanche exit from hell on earth.

I remember walking to my car and there is a gray haze everywhere. The local gov suggested for people to wear masks outside. Mind you, we are not talking about 15-20 miles away for the fires.

In one fell, who-could'a thunkit swoop and as a consequence of the ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION, more than 2/3rds of those Proposition 13 homes have burned down or otherwise unrecoverably been damaged. \r\n\r\nWhen homeowners rebuild, the State of California -- in backstabbing fashion -- will declare all Prop' 13 covered fire rebuilds to ALL be NEW STRUCTURES.  This means all new tax-standards, and that Prop' 13's 1978 tax break has suddenly become functionally extinct.  All this is because the Satanic threesome of the State, the County, and the City of Pasadena conspired to ignore their fire-abatement duties, leading to the wholesale burn out of all them tax-avoiding property-owners.\r\n\r\nPasadena is also going to make a grab at incorporating Altadena into Pasadena as a coopted tax-base.  That's the major reason it cooperated so completely with this community burn-out conspiracy.  With all them condemned properties being wholly unlivable, the former residents of those homes will now be former voters of Altadena.  This will make it so much cheaper for the City of Pasadena to bribe-out the remaining residents to sell cheap to the City's incorporation process."}

TBF our house caught flames likely within 40 minutes of the fire first breaking out and it was total pandamonium by where I was (I lived within a half mile of where it started). I can understand folks in my area (Way east of Lake at Altadena and New York Drive) not having any warning but those in west Altadena should have had WAY MORE NOTICE. This fire spread out of control for about 24 hours, there is zero excuse for those wireless alerts to have not come through. If the police/FD didn't knock on our doors to tell us to leave then there is no way they did it for the condensed parts of Altadena. I was able to see the flames about 15 minutes before the burning embers started raining on us, others did not have that luxury of being able to SEE the fire thousands of feet away before getting to grab some things to leave. Most had the warning of fire being at their doortstep. We got out the moment burning embers were landing and after having returned to see the damage we're lucky for it. We only had about 5 minutes until our house went up most likely."}

LA County was not prepared to manage the safety of the people in Altadena. It's sad...."}
