RIGHT. HEATHER. THANK YOU. WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE SEVERAL WILDFIRES ARE RAGING. ONE OF THOSE WILDFIRES IS BURNING AT ABOUT FIVE FOOTBALL FIELDS EVERY MINUTE, WITH POWERFUL WINDS SPREADING THE BLAZE THAT SCORCHED THOUSANDS OF ACRES. NOW, MANY RESIDENTS AROUND THE LOS ANGELES AREA ARE BEING FORCED TO EVACUATE. THE FAST MOVING FLAMES TRYING TO ESCAPE THOSE FIRES. EYEWITNESS NEWS REPORTER RAEGAN MEDGIE JOINS US LIVE WITH MUCH MORE ON THIS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SITUATION THAT'S REALLY STRETCHING RESOURCES THIN FOR FIRE CREWS OUT THERE. IT IS, YOU KNOW, AND WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY OUR FRIENDS OUT AT KABC THAT IS OUT IN LA. THAT'S OUR SISTER STATION. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY WATCHING THEIR LIVE REPORTS. AND ONE OF THE REPORTERS ON AIR RIGHT NOW, MARC COTA-ROBLES, HE CAME ACTUALLY UP HERE WHEN THE DODGERS AND THE YANKEES PLAYED FOR DURING THE PLAYOFFS. AND HE'S IN THE THICK OF IT. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. LOOK AT THESE IMAGES. I MEAN WE HAVE THEM ON OUR AIR RIGHT NOW. THIS IS HIS LIVE PICTURE. NOW. HE WAS YOU KNOW EVERY NOW AND AGAIN YOU'LL SEE HIM DUCK IN THE FRAME. AND HE IS WEARING A BRIGHT YELLOW VEST A JACKET. IT'S A FIRE RESISTANT JACKET. THAT'S BY LAW THAT THEY HAVE TO WEAR REPORTING OUT THERE ALONG WITH GOGGLES AND A MASK. THE MASK, BECAUSE THERE ARE FINE PARTICULATES IN THE AREA COVERING WILDFIRES. MYSELF, WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S VERY IT'S TERRIBLE BREATHING THAT AIR. BUT THIS IS THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES. THIS IS IN ALTADENA, CALIFORNIA. THESE FIRES ARE BURNING. IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA, THINK OF LA. THESE FIRES ARE BURNING NORTH, NORTHWEST AND NORTHEAST.

AND THEY'RE TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE WINDS ARE GOING TO DIE DOWN AS THE DAY GOES ON. EVEN MARK, THE REPORTER ON THE SCENE RIGHT NOW, HAD MENTIONED THAT THE WINDS ARE STARTING TO DIMINISH JUST A BIT, BUT HE CAN HEAR THE FIRE ALARMS GOING OFF IN HOMES THAT ARE NOT EVEN STANDING.

WHAT FIVE FOOTBALL FIELDS WORTH OF AN AREA IN ONE SECTION JUST FOR THE TRYING TO CONTAIN THIS, AND IT'S JUST NOT CONTAINED. IT CONTINUES. AND TO PUT ALL OF THIS IN PERSPECTIVE, OUR ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT MATT GUTMAN, HE LIVES THERE IN CALIFORNIA, AND HE HAS BEEN ALSO COVERING WILDFIRES FOR YEARS. AND HE SAYS HE'S NEVER FELT THIS UNSAFE AND THAT THE THREAT OF THE DANGER HAS NEVER FELT MORE REAL. WELL, IT'S TOUGH. IT'S TOUGH. THEY CAN'T GET UP. THEY'RE STUCK ON THE WHEELCHAIRS. WE GOT TO LIFT THEM UP, PUT THEM IN THE VANS AND THEN TAKE THE WHEELCHAIRS AT THE SAME TIME. SO WE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY OUT OF HERE. AND HERE'S ANOTHER THING.
