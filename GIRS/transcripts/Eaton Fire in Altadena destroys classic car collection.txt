WELL, THIS MORNING, FAMILIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE RETURNING TO THE RUBBLE IN ALTADENA. THIS CELL PHONE VIDEO SHOWS WHAT A FAMILY OF FOUR SAW AS THEY DROVE BY WHAT'S LEFT OF THEIR HOME TOWN. FORMER KPIX REPORTER AND ANCHOR AMANDA STARRANTINO HAS BEEN COVERING THE FIRE SINCE IT STARTED, AND SURVEYED SOME OF THE DAMAGE THIS MORNING. >>>>A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING, SO THIS WEEKEND, I DON'T EVEN THINK THEY CAN COME BACK TO THEIR PROPERTIES AND EVEN START THE REBUILD PROCESS. IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY, VERY LONG TIME UNTIL THEN. BUT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS PICTURE HERE. JUST LOOK AT THIS STREET. IT'S BEAUTIFUL, THESE TREES. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD THIS WAS. BUT THEN THE REALITY IS, EVERY SINGLE DIRECTION YOU LOOK AT THIS INTERSECTION HERE IN ALTADENA IS DESTROYED. ALL THESE HOMES ARE DOWN. THIS WAS JUST LINED WITH HOMES. AND SO HOMES, YES, THEY CAN BE REPLACED. THOSE MEMORIES THOUGH, HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET SOME PHOTOS. ANYTHING KEEPSAKES BEFORE THEY HAD TO QUICKLY EVACUATE HERE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T REPLACE. AND THIS PROPERTY REALLY JUST CAUGHT OUR EYE HERE. ALL THESE CLASSIC OLD CARS. AND I LOOKED AT THE GOOGLE IMAGES OF WHAT THIS STREET LOOKED LIKE. THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL GREEN CAR PARKED RIGHT IN FRONT. SO THIS IS A 1940S CHEVY. IT'S GOT THE OLD THREE SPOKE WHEEL. THOSE ARE HARD TO COME BY. THE SPARE TIRE KIT ON IT. THIS IS LIKE THOSE OLD GANGSTER CARS YOU USED TO SEE. IT HAS THOSE SUICIDE DOORS SO IT OPEN LIKE THIS. YOU CAN'T REPLACE THIS. YOU GOT ANOTHER 1947 COUPE RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHAT THIS CAR IS HERE. JUST THE FIRE COMPLETELY TOOK OVER IT. BUT MY PHOTOGRAPHER MIKE LOOKS BACK ON THAT CAR BACK THERE. THIS ONE IS PRETTY COOL. IT'S A 1960S LINCOLN CONTINENTAL. THIS IS LIKE THE CAR THAT PRESIDENT JFK WROTE IN. THAT'S LIKE A CONVERTIBLE. REALLY NEAT TO SEE ANOTHER CHEVY NEXT TO IT. WE HAVE SOME OLDSMOBILES OVER HERE. YOU CAN TELL BY THEIR FRONT VERY DISTINCT. AND THEN WE HAVE ONE MORE NEAT ONE THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU OVER HERE. THIS IS A DESOTO. IT'S A CUSTOM RIGHT HERE IN FRONT. AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT SOME VIDEO THAT WE SHOWED YOU, MY PHOTOGRAPHER MIKE MCGREGOR, WHO'S WITH ME, HE SHOT THIS WHILE ALL OF THIS WAS GOING UP IN FLAMES. AND, HE HAD TO STOP BECAUSE HE, HE COLLECTS CLASSIC CARS AS WELL. AND IT'S JUST DEVASTATING TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND. AND, YOU KNOW, THE HOMES ARE SO HARD. AND FOR SOME PEOPLE, CARS ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT TO THEM. SO THESE IMPORTANT KEEPSAKES THAT PEOPLE REALLY PUT THEIR HEART INTO, YOU KNOW, MEMORIES ARE SURROUNDED BY THESE CARS. PEOPLE BRING THEM TO SHOWS, THEY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, AND THEY'RE JUST LEFT HERE. AND IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A HOLLYWOOD SCENE. AND IF YOU LOOK BEHIND ME, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL, HUGE HOME FOR PEOPLE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A WONDERFUL BACKYARD AND IT'S NOW COMPLETELY GONE. AND PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN COME BACK TO EVEN SIFT THROUGH ANYTHING. BUT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN REALLY TAKE FROM THIS. THERE'S NOTHING TO SALVAGE HERE, AND THERE'S NOTHING REALLY TO BE SAVED. IT'S SO SAD. THERE'S EVEN STILL SOME SMOLDERING HERE. AGAIN, ALL THESE ROADS ARE BLOCKED OFF. TO ANYONE GETTING BACK HERE, YOU HAVE TO BE CREDENTIALED AND YOU HAVE TO BE AN ESSENTIAL WORKER OR FIRST RESPONDER TO BE BACK HERE. SO NO ONE REALLY BEING ABLE TO COME BACK TO THEIR PROPERTIES. THERE'S ALSO BEEN REPORTS OF PEOPLE LOOTING IN HERE. SO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS BEING VERY, VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHO'S COMING BACK HERE. BUT FOR THE HOMES THAT ARE STILL STANDING, WHICH ARE NOT MANY A
