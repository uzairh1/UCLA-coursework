quickly. Running right along those that hillside there and towards those homes. Again, if you are in this area, if you feel threatened, just like Chief Sam said, don't wait to evacuate. Just please leave your area. Don't put yourself or your family's life in danger, because we know that this can only get worse at this hour before it gets any better. And in my seen an air unit up there, water drop their chief. I did not see that. You don't see that. Okay, okay I see. Okay. We do see it right now. It's coming in the screen right now. It does look like a super scooper plane. Looks like it could be the super scooper. And that's a good sign. That's that's that's help. But against this winds and this fire, there goes a drop right there. Now remember to that's dropped at a pretty high altitude. And you can see the wind carried that water. This is difficult because the water from this wind wherever they dropped it that took off right along with the wind. So the accuracy of these drops, it's difficult for these pilots, but it's good to see this aircraft up. I want to bring in chief. I want to bring in our meteorologist Stephanie Olmo. Steph, can you talk to us about the gust, the winds that are the speed of the winds out there? Yeah. Right. Yes. As a matter of fact, here I'm looking at one of the maps here and the wind gusts right now generally around the area. It's between 30 to 40 miles an hour. As we continue here at this time. So this is why this is so concerning, because of course we have this fire going. It is difficult to control. We know how dry the conditions have been out there. So that's what we're talking about right now in terms of the wind gusts right now, wind speeds 15 to 20 miles an hour. As we continue. And Annabelle know we've been talking about this, but with this event that we have going on, I was looking at the Santa Ana Wildfire Threat Index, and this is something we were talking about the past couple of days because of how strong the winds are and just how dry the conditions have been, the fires, any fires that get going could grow rapidly. We're seeing it happen right now. It could burn intensely and be and it's very difficult to control. So as Chief Sam said, you know right now we have 20 acres, but I'm sure it's gone beyond that. And there's the concern with some homes in the area right now. Annabelle Steph, this is what we are calling a rare system. So the danger is out there. The concern is out there. The poor air quality is out there. So for anybody who doesn't live near this particular fire, they are still being affected by the air quality. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. That is right. You were talking about a rare situation and we call it it's what's called a particularly dangerous situation. Red flag warning. It's not something that gets issued all the time, but it's been the third time so far this season, Annabelle that it's been issued. And this time in particular, it is it's very strong because it's not just impacting the wind prone areas, but even the wind sheltered areas. As we've been discussing, like the Basin, like the valleys, for example. And so the winds are gusting pretty good right now just to know this is the beginning, they are still expected to ramp up as we continue here throughout the day. So again, just a reminder we're under a particularly dangerous situation. Red flag warning it is typically reserved for most extreme weather events like what we have going on today. Because of the very strong winds and low humidity. We have lots of dry fuels out there and as I mentioned, it's the third time this year that a PDS has been issued and we have that red flag out transition here. We have a red flag warning that remains in place really across much of the viewing area until Thursday, from Ventura County, all the way down to the Inland Empire. And again when we have the Santa Ana winds, sometimes it's usually for some portions of Ventura County, L.A. County. It's not all the time that we see all this under red flag warning, but it goes to show just how strong these winds are. And it's also it's also picking up in areas beyond those winds, those typical wind prone areas to areas like the Basin, for example. But let's see. Hold on. I just want to go over here and just update a couple of maps. But we do have I just want to get just more clarity on where we have the fire burning there in Pacific Palisades, where we do have gusts around the area and Pacific Palisades around 22 miles an hour. Santa Monica mountains. We're seeing gusts over 50 miles an hour. So that's what we're looking at right now. All right. Michael Brownlee is joining me here at the desk. Michael, you know you're coming in this morning. You're driving in. I'm sure you felt what everybody's been feeling. The strong gusts of winds, moving your car. And then, of course, seeing all of that debris. And now we're seeing this. Precisely this. Yeah. This is exactly what we have been sort of forecasting and warning our viewers about driving in from the West Side. There were some obviously palm trees swaying there. Obviously got over the hill into the San Fernando Valley. And again, those gusts really picked up. I want to bring Chief Sam back in here for a second because, chief, you hit on something. First of all, good morning. Good morning. I wanted to hit on something that you mentioned earlier. And that was the water dropping aircraft. At this point. What a challenge it is for them at this point. And how with the wind speeds and those gusts makes it very, very difficult because this is sort of a choreographed dance, if you will. Yeah, you're right. And right now just the speed of the winds are at 30 to 40. They're right at that threshold limit where they may become grounded. And I did get a text from Roland. He did say that helicopters were working this fire as well. But but with this wind, you know, to get those pinpoint accurate drops and they are great at it. There are a lot of times when a gust can take them and they can miss the target. In addition to the winds that they're facing now, what are some of the other challenges facing firefighters at this point? Well, the main thing our job is for the protection of life. They're getting evacuations going with this. But also, you know, this is kind of like I could use an analogy of a train. You know, it's hardo get in front of this fire right now. You're going to get run over. You got to run along the sides of it basically, you know, and just do the best you can to evacuate people and start doing structure protection. Chief, it's 1120 in the morning. If you are just tuning in, we want to just let you know that we are monitoring a fire in Pacific Palisades. It is probably well over 20 acres at this moment. Chief, as we've been talking about, we see that dark plume of smoke. And then what's more concerning at this hour is that it is very close to homes in that area. We do see a aircraft unit there, water dropping, water dropping in that particular area. But again, we're talking about the challenges that firefighters are facing today, especially with these wind gusts. Stephanie was talking about 30 to 40mph. Yeah it is. These are difficult fires to fight. No doubt. And resources. You need to have a lot of resources on this for doing structure protection. And we see a lot of homes in that area. This is going to be very challenging. This is just the beginning of a very long firefight ahead of us. And especially with the wind forecast to pick up throughout the day. That's concerning. So knowing what the winds will be as the afternoon progresses, and as Stephanie mentioned into Friday, actually into Thursday with this red flag warning, what are firefighters obviously in the midst of this fight here? What are they doing to prepare for what's to come? Well, we brought in a lot of resources, personnel being called in off duty pre-positioning of strike teams added extra patrols in the foothill area. We brought in resources from Northern California. So it's just bringing as much as you can to prepare for this fire. The nice thing is, in Northern California, they're getting a lot of rain up there. So you can send resources from Northern California because they're not facing what we're facing down here in Southern California. Chief, you're talking about how you guys are preparing. How much time in advance do you guys prepare for something like this? I mean, we've been talking about the winds that they were going to be strong these next three days. How much time in advance do you guys get as far as planning and preparing and sending out crews to our area? Well, we know we watch the weather and we get updates on the weather forecast when we know that this event was coming. Days in advance. Planning takes in effect, and I've got to hand it. I mean, I love the fire service. I've been doing it for so long, the best of the best in Southern California. We have the best, most robust mutual aid response. We started planning for this days ago to get resources down here and in order, thanks to the Office of Emergency Services and local fire departments here in Southern California. So, you know, you're you can only prepare for so much, and then you've got to deal with the force of Mother Nature, you know. Well, you mentioned early on, as Annabelle was giving statistics on the growth of this fire from two acres to 20. You say 20 plus acres at this point. You talked about the rate of spread. Explain that to our viewers and how the wind is playing a part in all of this. Yeah, we call it rapid rate of spread. And this isn't some heavier fuels and vegetation. That's why you're seeing a lot of the darker smoke. Those fuels have a lot of oil in them. Then you see some light smoke. But you know with this fire you've got a lot of embers. Remember, these fires can go one, two, three and sometimes even longer in miles that are going to start spotting ahead of this fire. So it's going to move very rapidly. We are looking at active flames. I'm sure you're watching this along with us. Active flames that seem to be precariously close to some structures. You mentioned possible evacuations at this point. Folks who haven't yet been evacuated should obviously prepare to be evacuated. Absolutely. You do not have to be told to evacuate if you're living in this area right now and you feel threatened, grab your medication. First aid. Excuse me? Medication, eyeglasses, laptop, important documents and find a home or place within your community. That's an evacuation center and leave. You know, Chief Sam, but we see it time and time again, though, during a natural disaster, a fire, you know, flood, what have you. You have those folks who decide to stay back and play hero. We've interviewed these folks. You've seen them. You hear what they have to say your words to them here this morning. Well, I'll say this. Do not do that. I cannot emphasize that. Enough. Experienced veteran firefighters with 20 plus years on the job with full personal protective equipment, with fire trucks, have been caught in burn overs and have been injured and even died. So for the novice homeowner at home and I've seen them, Michael, on their rooftops in shorts and thongs and a t shirt with a garden hose. I cringe when I see that. Don't do that. Do not stay in defend. You're not trained for it. You're not protected enough. Leave again. Your house. Your belongings can be replaced. Your life can not. And you know, and just to kind of reiterate on that, chief, I mean, does that even do anything if somebody's standing out there, are they even close to saving their home? You know, I mean, I just want people to understand that their attempt, you know, it's not it's not worth it because the chances of them actually saving their home when that fire is that close to them are very, very slim. Well, let's put it in just a different light. Get out of the shower, put your hair dry on on dry, on hot or medium dry. Put it on your on dry your hair. Within minutes it's going to dry out right. The same thing with the you're going to wet or pre-treat your roof or around your property. As soon as you stop with this dry, windy conditions, it's going to dry out very quickly. So go. Please evacuate. I cannot emphasize that enough. Don't play firefighter. Evacuate to a safe location. As Chief Sam, are you at all surprised by the number of aircraft that we've seen thus far? Considering those wind gusts Stephanie mentioned not too long ago? What? Stephanie 30 to 40 miles an hour. And yeah, actually the area at this point I'm looking at even the Santa Monica mountains, which is near we're talking about gusts getting close to 55 miles an hour at this time. So this is very strong. All right. So, Chief Sam, to answer the question here, some gusts as much as 55mph at this point. Are you surprised to see aircraft getting a handle on this, or at least trying to get a handle on this fire? Well, I'm not surprised because I know you know, everybody we want. Our job is to protect lives and property, so I'm not surprised by it. It is concerning. I won't be surprised if the winds kick up that they do get grounded. They're just trying to take the, no pun intended, the heat out of this fire as much as possible right now, and get a knock down as much. This is a window period for them. It may close pretty soon. Chief, we're seeing these blades. The fire in the middle of these, this dark plume of smoke. We see the aircraft also working really hard to, you know, just aim that water into the fire. We're speaking of the challenges. Let's talk about the air quality. For anybody who lives in the surrounding area. And what do you tell them? Good point. You know, you may not live in the foothills. You may not even be close to not just this fire, but any fire. But you could be impacted by the smoke if you are. If there's a fire in your area, stay indoors, close your windows, avoid strenuous outdoor activity, and just hunker down. Avoid it because it is dangerous. Right, chief? All right, chief Sam, if you can hold on. I want to bring Stephanie in once again, our meteorologist, Stephanie Olmo, who is monitoring the situation not only in the Pacific Palisades area, but of course, we're talking about this red flag warning all across major parts of Southern California here. So you look at the direction of the of the smoke at this point. You see those active flames. What are your first thoughts here? Well, obviously with the with the strong winds that we have, you're like oh boy. Right. So we're thinking about and you're seeing some of the communities right there and how close they are to the fire. So that is concerning. And this is why it's important for those who live in the area, just generally across the region. You want to make sure you have a plan set in place. You want to make sure you have your emergency kit because this is something that we were concerned about and seeing it happen here right now. And it looks like the fire is burning downhill. Typically when we talk about the fires and they burn uphill, they burn faster. But regardless, with the strong winds we have, I mean, it's growing rapidly. And with the concern just not only in that area but across the region, you think about the resources, right? It's very important to get a handle on this pretty quickly, but we know that's going to be difficult as we continue today. Michael. And as Chief Sam mentioned already, I mean, there's a very short window as to when the aircraft can actually be in the air, and he feels as if that window is slowly but surely closing. Right, exactly. So, especially as we continue throughout the day, Michael, and you have the winds increasing and the concerns are other fires getting started. Right? Right. And you want to make sure there are other resources just scattered across the area. So you're right about that. The window does close, just as he said. It's like the analogy of a train trying to get ahead of it. But yet it's such a challenge. All right, Stephanie, thank you for that. Yeah. And of course, this is only one of the areas that we are monitoring. We are monitoring so many other areas that are highly impacted by these winds. And that, of course, are also within that warning, right of fire danger. All right, you guys, it's about 1130. You see that live shot right there? The large plume of smoke. Right now it's at least 20 acres. But we believe possibly. According to Sam DiGiovanna, our expert here, he believes that's 20 plus acres. We have crews on the way to the scene and will bring you a live update later on this hour. All right. And joining us now on the phone is Chief Sam DiGiovanna, our NBC 4 fire expert chief. You know, for anybody who's just tuning in at this hour, we want to remind people, if you live in this surrounding area, have a kit ready to go. In the event that you need to evacuate. What should that kit have? Medication, eyeglasses, important documents in your laptop. Anything else can be. Leave it. Leave it behind. And I do want to go back to something on the acreage. I just got a report. This thing is now at probably even plus over 200 acres. That's how quickly, from the time we started this fire and started talking about it at 10 to 20 acres. And now it's over 200 acres. That's what I mean about the rapid rate of spread. So get that medication, eyeglasses, laptop and important documents. Get prepared to leave. And we cannot just. I'm sorry. Sorry, chief. And we can only assume that this fire is going to continue to grow at this fast rate. You're absolutely right. And that's what I was going to say. We're looking at this fire right now. So we're talking and focused on this fire. I'm saying this to everybody through Southern California. Take heed to this warning we're giving you now. You've got a window period right now. Take advantage of it. You're not under the duress that these people are. Get your things together and get ready to move on. Yeah. You talk about being proactive and ready, because if it's not happening in your neighborhood, there's a chance it possibly can. Chief, you hit on something earlier during our conversation about not only the fire that is burning here, we see the active flames and the smoke. But you talked about those embers. And when we talk about, you know, how far those embers can actually travel and when like this, we typically say a mile, but you say, what they we've had reports of fires, these embers can go 3 to 5 miles. It just depends on the wind, the fuel that's burning. So, you know, just when you think you've seen it all something you we find out that embers start, you know, burning or blowing further away. And this has happened in recent fires. So this is a good example of where it could happen. So not only that these embers, they're lighting the brush ahead of it, but these are the ones that also get into your patio furniture, trash can, wood piles, everything around your home, the attic vents. These are the things that cause these structures to burn down. So make sure you clear those and get your house prepped just as well. And especially I'm going to say it again to those that are not impacted by this. We're warning you right now, take advantage of this warning. Yeah. Something to keep in mind. Absolutely. Chief, if you can just give us a second here, we want to bring in NBC 4's Brittany, Hope and Brittany. You have friends who are currently being evacuated in this area. Hi. You guys. Yeah. So? So pardon me for checking my phone. I'm actually texting with them right now, so they haven't been told to evacuate, but because of the conditions, because of what they can see from their neighborhoods, they said they're getting their documents together, they're packing their bags, and they're making the decision upon themselves right now to evacuate. And it sounds like that's what a lot of their neighbors are starting to do as well. I'm hoping we can show you some of the videos that they sent to me. So if you could let me know in my ear if we're able to show you this is the view of their neighborhoods, both in the North Palisades and in the South Palisades. In both of these videos, you can see that huge plume of smoke stretching into the sky. That dark, dark black smoke as well. That's because at this point, at least from what they're telling me, they say they haven't seen any structures around them that have burned, but they have seen a lot of the hillside behind all of those neighborhoods that do have flame at this point. Now, their neighborhoods are really, really smoky. I actually texted my girlfriends, let's see at 11:00 about this, knowing that we were reporting on this. That's when they went outside where they had been living. That's when they saw all the smoke. And then they started getting everything together. At first it seemed to be off in the distance, but now it seems, at least from their perspective, that that the flames are certainly spreading more toward the neighborhoods and more toward the homes. And they said it started to grow really fast. There was about a five minute window at around 1110 where they said, okay, this thing is changing. We're going to take this seriously and just start to evacuate, prepare our documents, because they just don't want to risk it, you know? And I think that's a safe call. You heard chief saying that as well, you know, evacuate if you can be ready. This would be the time, especially because from one of my girlfriends, she said that traffic isn't too bad. Yet at this point, she was able to get in and out of the neighborhood. But as things change and as those flames continue to get closer to homes, that's when the traffic will also be backed up. As more road closures go in place as well. So I think taking their advice would definitely would definitely be good advice. If you live in that area. Brittany, and I think it warms every firefighters heart out there to hear that your friends made the conscious decision without an evacuation order to get their documents and get out. Did she at all describe what the neighborhood is like right now? Chief Sam talked about structure protection. Are there fire units within her neighborhood, or at least on the way out of the neighborhood? Yeah. So neither of them said that they had seen any engines in their neighborhoods yet they're not in that neighborhood. That right backed up to the flames there in the north and southern part of the Palisades. So that's if the videos that we showed you, you can see they can kind of see it behind the homes across from them. So at this point, they didn't tell me if there was any apparatus. But again, I know they're actively evacuating. So they're kind of just giving me updates as they could and sending videos. But I have them on, on location on our iPhones. So I've been kind of watching their dots as they've made it out. But I'll make sure when we get off, I'll text them and ask them if they've seen any fire engines up in the neighborhoods yet. All right, Brittany, thank you very much for that. We will continue to, of course, monitor that situation. If you can just give us a sec. Here it is 1136 in the morning here. And we can confirm at this hour that it is the fire has grown now to at least 200 acres. And we are, of course, talking about the Pacific Palisades fire. But this is one of the concerns that we had. Michael, we've been talking about it now for a few days. The winds, the gusts. I mean, Stephanie was talking about winds now being at, what, 50mph or so. We want to bring in our meteorologist Melissa Magee also who's joining us here in studio to talk about this concern now. Yes. Annabelle and Michael, Stephanie and I are here monitoring the fire and weather conditions. And like you mentioned, the gusts there are starting to get a little stronger. Our observation data is showing you with the Palisades fire, we've got gusts close to the Palisades at about 27mph. But you move off to the north and west. Santa Monica mountains. It's much stronger there. And that's the concern as we go throughout the rest of the late morning hours into the afternoon and later on tonight. So right now we've got winds gusting anywhere from 54mph. As I look at the relative humidity, it's ranging anywhere from 35 to about 45%. So that's not much of a concern right now. We had the Franklin Fire there in Malibu last December last year, and relative humidity was much lower than that. So this is what we like to call a wind driven fire. And also a topography driven fire as well. We've got significant Santa Ana winds on the way as we go throughout the rest of tonight and into our overnight hours, into Wednesday, looking at some of the gusts across the region. They're ranging anywhere from 30mph at LAX, typically in areas where we don't typically see very strong winds to spots up into the mountains there in Santa Monica mountains, where there are over 50mph. Also, I want to show you the wind triangle or at least explain it to you. Typically, when we're talking about the wind triangle, that's a fire that's fueled by three ingredients. First, the topography. So as we look to the screen and we see the image on our left here, looking at the live picture of the fire currently burning, there's a mountain, or at least a foothill and a slope. So you've got Santa Ana winds moving into topography where you've got a lot of brush and you've got a lot of dry vegetation on the on the ground, adding to the issue with this rapidly growing fire. Also, the weather in this case, and in this scenario, we've got strong Santa Ana winds that are only going to get stronger as we go throughout the rest of tonight. And then the other part of the triangle is the fuel. Well, what's the fuel in this situation? It's bone dry. We haven't seen Stephanie mentioned. We've not seen any significant rainfall in months. In fact, for L.A. County specifically, a little bit more than a 10th of an inch of rainfall. So that's adding to the problem, which is why we've got this red flag warning. Yes, the Santa Ana winds are here. They're going to strengthen tonight. But then we've got this red flag warning that has been extended until 6 p.m. On Thursday. So dry Santa Ana winds, which will drop the humidity significantly. And that's why we're seeing images in the pictures you're seeing to the left on your screen with this Pacific Palisades fire that is burning more than 200 acres right now. You know, yesterday, Melissa, during our 4 or 5 and 6:00 newscast, we talked about how what we were going to get this morning and possibly into the afternoon was just an appetizer of what's to come. Right? So we're talking about stronger winds as the hours progress. Right. So let's set the scene for you and set the stage for you over the next 12 to 24 hours. In terms of what we are anticipating here as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon hours, we're going to continue to see winds ranging anywhere from, I would say, 30 to about 50mph. Steph, would you be in agreement with that? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. As we go throughout the rest of the afternoon and then once we get into tonight, especially for some of those mountain and foothill communities, it's going to get even stronger. So overnight tonight into your Wednesday morning, the winds will likely peak even more so in terms of where you live. If you wanted to plan out the rest of your day for the coast and the valleys, winds gusting anywhere from 60 to 70mph, especially later on tonight. And so these are areas that are typically wind sheltered, meaning you don't really see the Santa Ana's that often. This is a very unusual case for the mountains, San Bernardino Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, up across the Santa Monica mountains, winds gusting anywhere from 65 to 80mph. And there could be some isolated spots where you've got winds close to 100mph in some rare cases. So that's the case as we go throughout the rest of tonight. In terms of our community and residents living in and around this area, what you can do to prepare right now is make sure you have a ready, set, go plan in place and also take precaution. There will likely be downed trees, power outages in your area, so make sure you are prepared now for what's likely to come later. Michael and Annabelle. All right, Melissa, thank you very much for that. I mean, that is very concerning. 30 to 50mph in the coast, 60mph, 65mph or more, even in the mountains, and then 100mph in certain areas. So you were hearing these numbers. And we don't want to be alarmist here, but we do just want to keep you safe. We want to keep your family safe, and we want you guys to take the precautions necessary, especially if you live in these affected areas. All right. Joining us now on the phone is L.A. City Council member. Traci Park Council member, thank you very much for joining us this morning. Thank you for having me. You know, we're seeing these images live here in our studio on the cameras here, we see this dark plume of smoke. What do you want the viewers to hear from you? Well, I want folks to know that this is a very serious matter. We are very concerned about the dry conditions, the wind. This fire is growing quickly and moving quickly, and we anticipate that evacuation orders will be coming shortly to affected communities in Pacific Palisades. We urge everyone to please remain calm and pay attention to orders as they're being given. Move quickly if and when that order comes, and know that our public safety partners are on the front lines, working very, very hard to get this under control as quickly as possible. Let's talk about resources. Council member parks. Do we have enough or are we relying on mutual aid from other parts of the state? From the county? What can you tell us? So right now we have many, many resources on scene from LAFD. There are multiple fires actually burning in the county and the city, so I don't know yet whether we will activate mutual aid, but if necessary, we absolutely will do so. We have our command post being set up at Will Rogers State Beach as well as Fire Station 23 and the emergency Operations Center has been activated as well. I personally have council office staff at the EOC and the command post at Will Rogers State Beach. We are following this very carefully and communicating out to our residents updates as we have them count. Council member I'm sorry, can you talk to us about shelters? Will we have shelters in place for any of these affected residents in this area? And then, of course, people who do have bigger animals. So we may and we may need to execute those plans, which is why it is so urgent that all of our community members are paying very close attention and following the directions that they're given. I will share more information as we have it, and we will keep that information coming. I will personally be out on scene shortly as soon as we wrap up our meeting here at City Council. But we are very, very concerned about this and acting quickly to ensure that we are protecting our property and lives as well as animals. So we're going to do whatever it takes to keep our community safe. Councilmember, you, we talked about the rapid rate of speed of this fire from two acres to 20. Now we're talking 200 plus acres. What is your biggest concern and your biggest fear at this point? Well, obviously the speed at which this is growing and moving, which is enhanced by the very dry conditions and the wind, obviously, the evacuation routes and the smooth flow of egress as these orders come to fruition are the things that I am most concerned about. We have a very highly trained and well-prepared department and communities. We are not new to these situations, but we remain very, very cautious and concerned, and we look forward to a cooperative, orderly process as we manage this scene as it unfolds. Your message to your constituents out there in the fire zone to be proactive. We've talked to spoken to one of our reporters whose friends heeded the warnings. They figured no evacuation orders yet, but they are heading out with all of their important documents, medications and such. Is that your message to your constituents? That's right. Everybody should be prepared. Gather your personal items, pets and essentials that you need to take with you, and folks need to be prepared to leave at a moment's notice. Notice if that order comes. Councilmember power is do we know if it's if it's been shut off over there? I don't presently have that information, and I would defer to LAFD and or DWP or the utilities. I don't have that info. And then what's the best way for anybody who lives in this area to get some more information that you guys are releasing immediately? Certainly following the local news, they can track this at the LAFD website and certainly through my office, and folks can stay tuned on social media at Councilwoman Traci Park, I will be posting information throughout the day, as will our partners at LA Fire Department. Okay, Councilmember Traci Park, we appreciate your time. And as she mentioned, they have a command post set up at Will Rogers State Beach. Of course, she will be out there on the front lines, if you will, at that command post, speaking with constituents and of course getting a handle on what is happening out there in Pacific Palisades. We want to bring you back. NBC 4's Brittany. Hope. Brittany, as you mentioned earlier, you have friends who live in the area who have chosen to evacuate, even though there are no orders in place at this point. You have an update for us. Yes. So I just spoke with both of them. So the very latest from one of them is that yes, they were able to evacuate. They said that getting down the hill, there's a lot of traffic on PCH. They said it's pretty much gridlock if you're trying to head to the ten because they said it seems like a lot of their neighbors are evacuating as well. Everyone is kind of going down that Palisades Hill. One of my other girlfriends is still packing up, but she she went outside of her house and she said all of her neighbors were outside watching as the flames kind of came toward them from that hill. They haven't been given evacuation orders yet. Usually in the case, you know, you see the sheriff's office going door to door blaring their sirens. She hasn't seen that yet. But again, she's still preparing everything. I can tell you what she's hearing from a lot of her neighbors is that folks who are trying to get up the hill, whether it's up sunset, whether you're trying to get up through the Getty Villa, trying to go up Palisades Drive, there's a lot of fire engines there. Even L.A. County lifeguard trucks headed that way. And police. So they said getting up the hill is proving to be a challenge. Understandably so. It sounds like anecdotally, there might be some road closures, but a lot of people also just rushing home, right, to get all of their important things so they can collect all of those and then evacuate if needed. So it's really a fluid situation, but it certainly seems like there's a lot of backup. Now, another issue at play here is also that Topanga Canyon has been closed since 10 a.m. This morning, way before the fire, because the winds have been so powerful. So a lot of the people who are trying to evacuate from the Palisades are having to go on PCH toward the ten. So that's also another factor, right? They can't just take Topanga into the Valley. They have to go all the way to the ten. So there is a lot of cars and a lot of people just trying to go somewhere, but it sounds like no one is really moving that fast. All right, Brittany Hope, thank you very much for that. We will continue to touch base with you in just a few moments. We want to bring in Chief Sam back. Chief, you know, we were listening to Brittany talk about these road closures. I was certainly stuck on the 101 freeway this morning trying to come into work and along with everybody else who now has to use the 101 freeway because Topanga Canyon is closed as people are getting ready to leave. This is a big concern. Let's talk about the game plan here and what you recommend people do who are who are needing to get out of this area. Yeah. Again, like I've emphasized earlier, even if you're not ordered, evacuate. If you're in the area and you feel that you could be or you feel threatened, evacuate now. Otherwise, when apparatus are coming up the hill and you're trying to get down the hill, it could cause gridlock. So stay ahead of the game. It's so important for people to remember that. Don't wait until the last minute. Yeah. You know, we just had council member Traci Park on, and I think you guys all read from the same playbook here because we talk about being proactive and, you know, being on your game, if you will, before anything happens. And we spoke to our colleague out in the field, Brittany Hope, who has a couple of friends who have decided to be proactive and get out of the neighborhood. And we talked about the gridlock on PCH at this point. And again, what it is like to get in and out of those neighborhoods. So again, Chief Sam, your words don't fall on deaf ears. That is for sure. You know, Michael, if you look at what we're seeing right now, that looks like a spot fire right there. Do you see that fire ignited further away from the homes, and it's burning right there. The white smoke right there that's burning. That's likely a spot fire that has burned, traveled a half mile. Quarter. I can't tell, but that's taking off right now. Right in the midst of those. And then it's going to fall right down into that little canyon in there. That's a chute and a canyon that's very dangerous because we know, just like we talked about this, I don't know if it was Stephanie or who brought it up earlier. Melissa, about topography. That's true. The speed of this fire is also going to be topography driven. Fire moves 16 times faster on an uphill surface than on a flat surface. So when it gets into a canyon or goes up a canyon, it's going to move a lot quicker. There's a good example of something that could happen and look at it spotting even further to the left of this. And we can only expect to see more of these spot fires, chief, especially with the gusts. You know, our meteorologist we're talking about at this point, they're about they're about 50mph. Yeah. You know, and that's that's strong. Even if a 20 or 30 mile an hour wind is concerning, we're talking 50 miles an hour with the possibility of these increasing through the day. I can't emphasize this enough, and I'm sorry, but I have to say it. Get prepared. Now we're seeing one fire. It's like living in California with earthquakes. It's not a matter of if, but when. I'm going to say this for the next couple of days, it's not a matter of if we're going to have another fire, but when and where. There will be more fires. Take advantage of this warning and, and be prepared. You know, Chief Sam, it's interesting because the spot fire that we just picked up on here, I don't know if the camera is going to move back, but that's just proof positive that even though this isn't burning near your home, you're not there's not necessarily a safety zone within this area that that we're looking at here. Yes, the fire and the smoke may be engulfing one part of the Palisades. But again, that spot fire, those folks probably thought, hey, we're in the clear. But you know what? We talk about the gusts. You talk about the winds. You talk about how far one of those embers can travel. And again, there is no safety zone within what we're looking at here. Not at all. They're right in the path of it. And we're going to see more of it as we're scanning to the left. Right now there's another one. This is a good example. Unburned fuel in between these spot fires. So you know that this is just created by a spot fire. And it's just going to continue and keep traveling. And I have heard that they are doing evacuations all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway. That's just what I was told. So evacuations are happening right now. Take advantage of them and leave. And we do want to reiterate the 101 freeway is heavy. The 405 freeway is being impacted as well. And the ten freeway. And of course, keeping in mind that there are many road closures. So, chief, I just kind of want to reiterate what you've been talking about is that if you live in this area, but, you know, are potentially feeling that threat, leave immediately. Don't wait until you're evacuated. So true. And I'm going to say this from when we started less than an hour ago, this was way up high in the hills. Look how far low, how quickly this fire has moved. All right, chief Sam, if you can stay on the line here for us, we want to bring in a meteorologist and Melissa Magee again. We talked about where the fire started earlier today in the canyon. Up high up on the hill. It's moving its way down here at this point, causing a major threat. Right. Very interesting what Chief Sam was saying too, about the spot fire, in the sense that we are dealing with a wind driven fire. We've got significant Santa Ana winds moving on through. And the example we always use is that you're dealing with Santa Ana's, and it's blowing those embers around and it's blowing the flame around. So when you have a flying ember that typically travels about a mile, but when you have rare situations like this, they can travel a little longer, a little farther than that. And that's what we're seeing with the case right here in unburned fuel in between the spot fires as well. Looking at some of the live imagery of these pictures here, fires getting very close to these homes here. And there's a lot of vegetation to just above that home to you guys. So that's a big concern as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon into tonight. There's that bush looks nice and green. So there's plenty of fuel for this fire to attack as it works its way down the hill. And the winds are erratic in a situation like this downhill, the wind doesn't travel as far, but when you're dealing with winds and flames that travel uphill, the larger the flame or the stronger the wind, the faster it travels up the hill, for example. So this is a big concern as we're looking at these homes threatened by the fire in Pacific Palisades. We've got winds in that area ranging anywhere from about 20mph close to the Santa Monica mountains. We've got winds gusting up to 53mph. There's a lot of smoke in that area. You know, we talked about yesterday, Melissa, during our newscast, I think the terminology we use when it came to rain in Southern California, bone dry. Bone dry. Very. Yeah. You can see it there. This is part of the problem. I mean, it's been at least six months since we've seen any significant rainfall. We've got a deficit of close to 3.5in. And the end result, or at least the indirect result, is that you get fires like this very burning, very close to homes. With all of that brush and vegetation as well. So if you're in that community, you know, do what you can to be safe, have a plan in place. If you are seeing the images that we're showing you on the screen, this is probably your opportunity to act. Now in terms of clearing brush and debris around your home. If you are not directly impacted by the fire that's currently burning in the Palisades, but it is bone dry, it's going to get drier. Michael and Annabelle as we go throughout the rest of tonight, dropping that relative humidity, which adds to the fuel and adds to the potential of Santa Ana's spreading more fires. So yes, and of course we were talking about that oil too. That's also igniting this fire. Right. So you saw that green bush there, right? Bright green. But that has a lot has a lot of oil. And so that could easily ignite. Exactly. I mean, that's part of the wildfire triangle is what we like to call it. That's the fuel. That's the topography. And that is the situation that we're dealing with, with the significant wind event that's taking place right now. All right. We want to bring in Chief Sam DiGiovanna back here. Chief, you know, we're talking to Melissa here, our meteorologist, along with Stephanie Olmo. We're talking about these winds. They're erratic and we're talking about the embers as well. You're saying that these embers can travel 3 to 5 miles, especially in gusts like this? Yeah, yeah, let's just say this erratic winds create erratic fire behavior. And that's exactly what we're seeing right here is a lot of erratic fire behavior moving very quickly. Chief. Sam, we are looking obviously at live images here in the Palisades during the day when these winds and wind gusts are supposed to increase later this afternoon into the overnight hours. What is going to be the biggest challenge for firefighters at that particular point? Well, it's going to be hard to say, Michael, because we may get more fires in between now and when the winds really kick in. That's going to create a lot of resource, you know, to take care of these. Let's put it in perspective. And I talked about this during the Franklin Fire. You could have 250 fire engines on a fire, on this fire or in the Franklin Fire. That's a lot of fire trucks. But when you put it into perspective, you could have 2000, 3000 homes. That's hard to defend. 3000, 4000 homes when you have 250 or 300 fire trucks. Just doing the math, you're outnumbered. So hoping that we don't get too many more fires through the day. So we keep our resource availability there. But one thing I will say, like I mentioned earlier, the most robust mutual aid ever in the state of California, the most professional firefighters, they will do their job and they will do their best. And I promise you, they will save homes and communities. You know, I certainly don't want to interrupt you. While you were speaking, but we just saw two magnificent. At least what I thought were magnificent water drops here. Can you talk a little more about the. I'm assuming those are the super scoopers you mentioned earlier? Yeah, those pick up about 1200 gallons of water in about the same amount of seconds, 1500 gallons of water in about 12 seconds. What a great asset they are. And I saw it too. And I thought, wow, I love seeing that and hopefully they'll stay up longer. The winds will cooperate, but I don't think that's going to happen later through the day. How long do you think they will be able to continue to battle this blaze? Or at a certain point when these winds start getting stronger, will they have to just stop the air fight? Well, that will be up to the incident commander and the air operations chief. They'll know when it's time to stop, you know, to ground the air, because it just may be too dangerous for them. So the nice thing is, is that the newer helicopters, the helicopters have the night vision goggles that they use at night, providing the wind will cooperate. So at least the helicopters can continue on through the night. If the wind is cooperative. All right. So, Chief Sam DiGiovanna, we would like for you to hold Annabelle. We're just getting word here that the LAPD has gone on tactical alert because of all of this adverse weather, the conditions, obviously, the fire evacuations and, of course, tactical alert means they are on heightened alert at this point. Traci Park City Council member Traci Park talked about how, you know, if, if and when there's a mutual aid situation that needs to be activated. She, of course will do that as well. Again, as we continue to monitor this fire here in the Pacific Palisades, and we're seeing these live images, it's about noon. We're continuing our 11 a.m. Newscast coverage. Here. We have breaking news. There's a wildfire burning in the Pacific Palisades area right now. It has burned at least. And we say at least 200 acres. We have crews on the way to the scene. We will bring you a live update from them later this hour. We want Right now we're calling for winds for the coast and the valley. Anywhere from 60 to 70mph. That's very strong. And in the mountains, anywhere from 65 to about 80mph. And some of those gusts could be stronger in some of those isolated mountain communities. Watching the images that we're seeing on our screen as well, with the fire and the flames coming very close to those homes with all of that dry vegetation on the ground. I want to show you what we can anticipate as we go throughout the rest of tonight. For the rest of this afternoon, I would say from now till about nine, 10:00, we're going to have winds anywhere from about 20 to 50mph for the coast and the valleys, and also blowing debris, as we're seeing. You probably saw some of that. If you're driving into work this morning, leaves, trees, branches just scattered about, downed trees and power outages very likely in some communities. Once we get into tonight. So I would say about nine, 10:00 tonight, you'll start to see the winds really ramp up. They are going to intensify later tonight into Wednesday morning. So still calling for gusts anywhere from 60 to 80mph. That's from the coast, through the valleys and up to the mountains. And like I mentioned, some of these mountain spots could have winds in excess of 80mph. Tomorrow morning we've got another burst of wind from Mother Nature. And this will likely lead to a slower morning commute. So this is very dangerous. And this is why we say you need to act now. You need to have a plan in place. Not only do we have the threat with the Santa Ana's, but the red flag warning is going to stay up, even though we're calling for the height of the wind event tonight into Wednesday. The red flag warning is going to stay up until 6 p.m. On Thursday. So what does that mean? That means not only do we have the winds, but we also have dry conditions on the on the ground, dry and low relative humidity. Right now we're seeing the relative humidity numbers in the lower teens. This will likely lower as we go throughout the rest of tonight and into our Wednesday, which will elevate our fire danger. What we're seeing right now with the images here on the left, rapid fire growth is a big concern, and this is a prolonged Santa Ana wind event, a long duration event. It's not just today. It is tonight into our Wednesday two Micah Ma'a and Annabelle. All right, Melissa, thank you very much for that. Thank you for updating us on those numbers. And then of course, just setting the scene for us, for all of us later on tonight, we can expect those gusty winds to just ramp up even more. So all right. Joining us now on the phone is NBC 4's Karma Dickerson Karma. We're about to argue exactly. So we can get a better idea. I'm on Palisades Drive not far from sunset. This is one of the main thoroughfares in and out of the Highlands neighborhood. And what we're seeing is honestly pure pandemonium and chaos. And I don't say that lightly. Getting in here. Traffic is bumper to bumper people in a panic of trying to escape the areas further north have taken over both lanes of traffic. So the ingress, the egress, both sides of traffic are filled with people going out. So much so that we've seen fire trucks. I personally saw at least 6 to 8 fire trucks not able to progress any further up the hill to try to get to the fire, because so many people are trying to run down. The fire has already made it though, to this level, I'm watching right ahead of me a hillside burning fire coming down towards the roadway as we speak. There are some homes and structures, actually a good landmark to keep in mind. Calvary church right here on Palisades Drive. It is. We're right at that area, and I'm watching a fire burn closer and closer to it. Actually, I'm looking straight ahead of me, and I've now seen that the winds have taken the fire to the palm trees that are in the middle of the road. So imagine Palisades Drive traffic goes either way in either direction. And in the middle there's a line of palm trees dividing the different sides of travel. And right now there are palm trees in the center divider that are on fire. So that's an idea of how strongly these winds are whipping and how fast this fire is spreading. All around us. We see people with their dogs. They're running. You see people with suitcases that are walking down the road because you can't move. Traffic isn't moving, so people are doing what they can to get out. And that is walking themselves out. I heard a fire department because right now emergency responders are trying to figure out how to get people out of this area. And I heard one. Firefighter trying to communicate with LAPD saying, people are running for their lives. We need a free exit to PCH. They got to do whatever they can to get traffic moving towards PCH. So these people can get out of here, because not only are people having trouble leaving their homes, that means fire crews are having trouble getting, at least from this direction up to the fire. So what we're seeing are a lot of scared people, a lot of confused people and people who can see the fire right in front of them as they're sitting in their cars feeling pretty hopeless, not able to move in either direction at this point. So that's what we've got. Michael and Annabelle. Yeah, you know, Karma, as you make your way into the neighborhood, we're looking at live images from your photojournalist who you'll hook up with here shortly. We do see a number of fire personnel in these neighborhoods. And Chief Sam earlier spoke about the importance of structure protection. Obviously, this is exactly what's happening in this particular neighborhood right now. But you talked about the chaos and the folks, you know, frantically trying to get in and out of that neighborhood again. Are has this been what you've seen from the moment you began your journey to this neighborhood, or is this something that's just sparked there recently? Yeah, from the moment we began coming from PCH onto sunset right here on the Flatiron side. Or, you know, if you can, if you can let that fire department know, they'll they'll help you. That was a person coming up to me asking for help. He's got a flat tire. Imagine this chaos of people trying to evacuate the neighborhood. He's in the middle of the traffic and he's got a flat tire, so he can't even move his car. So just compounding issues out here. But to answer your question, from the moment we got here, even close to the fire, at least approaching from the west side, coming from PCH onto sunset, it was a back to back. We saw kids in school uniforms, parents frantically trying to get kids from schools, a lot of people on foot because making it anywhere in a car, at least from this direction, and this approach is impossible at this point. So we're seeing narrow streets there. Karma the visibility is very poor. And then we're also seeing, you know, can you imagine just being in this area that smoke is just burning your eyes? It's heavy. It's hard to breathe when you're in these conditions. I mean, from covering fires, I know very well what that feels like. And so for all of these people who are under distress and then trying to get out, these are some challenging conditions. And then of course, trying to maneuver around the fire engines that are there. I mean, there's a lot of activity going on in these particular areas. Yeah. And watching it change so quickly, as I mentioned, I came from the West side. So I drove through Santa Monica Palisades. We had a beautiful bluebird day. Yes, very windy. But as we are sitting here stuck in traffic right now, you can see the smoke rolling in. I put on my because obviously as journalists coming into these areas, we're aware of the gear that we're supposed to have. So I have on some goggles. Otherwise I couldn't. I could barely see because of all the ash that was in my eyes. That's how much the wind is blowing. The ash is coming on to windshields. It's coming into eyes. It is now gray. Here it was blue when I pulled up into this traffic jam, and it's now gray. The wind is still whippin. And again, watching these, watching the winds actually carry the flames to new places. It's pretty scary to watch that. So I can't imagine someone in their car wanting to move, but feeling like the fire is just coming closer and closer and closer. For what it's worth, there are absolutely first responders out here doing everything they can to try to facilitate this. They're trying to make a path to get people out. They're trying to get people on the correct side of the road. So traffic flows in the way that it's supposed to be flowing, in a way that's going to help people get out as quickly as possible, so they're aware of the challenges and they're trying to address it. There's just so many people trying to move quickly right now. It's just faster than what first responders are currently able to keep up with. Let's talk about while we have you, Karma. And before we let you go, Annabelle obviously hit on the point of air quality visibility. What are winds like out where you are right now? I wouldn't I wouldn't go as far as to estimate how fast these winds are moving, but I can say it's significant. You can feel and hear the wind and I can see the palm trees swaying under the weight of the wind. And I'll say it again, for me, the biggest indication of the winds that we're seeing is watching the embers, watching the winds pick up the flames that I see across the roadway, and then seeing something new that is on fire. That's the biggest indication for me that there is, you know, that there is significant wind out here. So that remains a concern at this point. All right. So Karma, we're going to let you catch your breath here. We appreciate great insight here for us on exactly what is happening, especially in the PCH sunset area. We have split screen here. This for you. Obviously that is the aerial shot if you will, on the left hand side of the Pacific Palisades. Fire over to the right. We have a live ground shot here. This is a mobile shot if you will. This is our Alex Rozier and his crew headed to the scene here on PCH. Yeah, and we could see he's going into this dark plume of smoke. And we do see that traffic just building up again. We want to remind people there are a lot of people who are trying to get out of this area, people who are also, unfortunately, getting word that their home may be in danger of burning. And so they're trying to make their way to their home. Now, we've been speaking to chief, Sam and Chief, we want to bring you back in. You're telling these people, stay away. Anybody that is should not be in this area. Stay away. Looky loos. We're even trying to go back to your home. Stay away. As you heard, Karma report earlier, people are trying to evacuate. It's bumper to bumper. They're not moving, and fire trucks are at a standstill. We can't help anyone or protect structures if we can't make access. All right, chief. Sam, you saw if you were with us here. We had that live shot at split screen. Right now, we are in a neighborhood here with one of our photojournalists. At this point, you saw the number of fire personnel in those neighborhoods. You saw those folks frantically packing up their vans to get out of these neighborhoods. This is exactly what we want to see. Those folks attempting to leave, to get out without any evacuation orders, though you say there might be 1 or 2 in place at this point, but structure protection is quite important at this point, and that's exactly what they're focused on. Correct. Exactly. Evacuating, getting people evacuated safely. Thank God for the law enforcement officers that are assisting us in a unified command. And we'll do the structure protection. They're going to do the evacuations, and we need the public's cooperation. I've said this many times, and I'm going to say it again, we will do our part. We just need the community members to do their part. And that's being prepared and follow orders. When to evacuate. Chief, you know, as we're looking at, some of these people exit, we want to remind people also that senior citizens also live in some of these homes. What's a recommendation for them and or anybody who may need some assistance here? Great question. Check on your neighbors, especially those that are senior citizens or some that may be handicapped. Check on them and make sure that they're able to. You may have to evacuate for them, but check on your neighbors. Absolutely. All right, chief, thank you very much for your time. If you can just kind of hang on here, we want to get back to Karma Dickerson. She's in that area. She's been talking weather. Okay, we want to head to meteorologist Melissa Magee. Bring her in. And meteorologist Stephanie Olmo. What do you guys have for us as far as updates? Well, we've got a lot of information just with our technology, you guys, that we can track the wind and the fire. Very interesting. You know, we use our First Alert radar network to track not only rain and snow. Also, if we can at some point I want to show you our visible satellite imagery. If you look just to the north and west of Santa Monica, that's not a cloud, that's the smoke and that's the smoke because of the Santa Ana winds that are blowing in from the north and east, all the way down to the south and west. So that large plume of smoke you see, just to the north and west of Santa Monica is blowing all of that smoke from the Palisades down into the Pacific Ocean. So that's a lot of smoke in the atmosphere. There's a lot of particulate matter in the atmosphere as well. In terms of what we're seeing with the latest wind gusts, because this is likely a wind driven fire here. The Palisades, we've got winds gusting up to 70mph. Santa Monica mountains, we've got winds gusting up to 55mph, relative humidity ranging anywhere from about 36 to 40%. So it's somewhat dry, but it's going to get drier tonight as those winds coming in out of the north and west, north and east rather just siphon all of this moisture we have in the air and dries out the atmosphere. I want to show you some fire tips. If you're in and around the Palisades, if you are supposed to evacuate and you have to head outdoors, or if you're just in an out and about at this afternoon, if you see the smoke or the ash, remain indoors. Close the windows right now. You know, avoid any physical activity outside. If you're very close to the Palisades burning. If you have to go outside, keep it brief. Use a mask. Of course, if you're evacuating, that's a bit of a different story. You have to get out and you have to do so quickly. I want to show you some of the wind reports we're seeing right now. Magic Mountain Truck trail gusting up to 84mph. Arrowhead Springs, 72mph. Escondido Canyon, not too far from Malibu, 62mph. East Simi Valley, 58mph. And I just put in Los Angeles because typically LA is a spot that's sheltered from the winds. We don't typically get in on the Santa Ana wind activity 36mph here in the Basin. Current gusts across the region ranging anywhere from about 46. In Santa Ana, we've got gusts and Van Nuys close to 40 over 40 in Santa Clarita. And this is just the beginning of our event, you guys. We're tracking the peak of the winds that will likely move in as we go throughout the rest of tonight and into our Wednesday morning. And you can see from the imagery, the live pictures on your left here, all of that smoke in the atmosphere. There's a lot of ash and a lot of particulate matter in the air. So air quality likely will be impacted as we go throughout the rest of the day, too. I'm just looking at the wind gusts map here that you guys put up. Ontario 51 mile an hour wind gusts, right? Right. So if you look at the shading here, it's a little cropped off. But when you see the purples on your screen the dark purples, that's winds anywhere from 40 to 50mph. And then the lighter shade of lavender, you could say, or the white, that's winds anywhere from about 50 to 60mph. And everybody is finding the activity as we go throughout the rest of tonight. So that's going to be an issue with downed trees, power outages. If you're on the roads, you know, ten and two on the steering wheel because it's stiff out there driving and a lot of branches and blowing debris and trash on the freeways at this hour as well. So this is just the beginning of our heightened event. Bottom line, no one is spared here. I mean, right, you look at it. Wow. You know, and what's also concerning Melissa is that you mentioned that at nighttime, that's when the winds are going to really pick up. I heard them last night and I was freaking out. I woke up, it must have been, what, maybe 3 or 4:00 in the morning? And I thought my house was going to write, you know, come down. So there are ebbs and flows with the system that we're tracking. We've got winds that were heightened overnight while a lot of us were sleeping. We're dealing with it right now. There will likely be a small lull. I don't want people to put their guard down because they're still going to be strong and stronger than what we're typically seeing with Santa Ana's, there will be a likely be a small lull later on this afternoon, but then it's going to pick back up as we have this area of low pressure responsible for all of this, that's setting up across the Great Basin, and it's driving down those northeasterly winds all the way down to the coast. So it's a big concern. It's a particularly dangerous situation. I know Steph mentioned it earlier today. Belen mentioned it this morning. The last time we had one, the National Weather Service uses this language when they want people to be prepared. Right. So we had one in December. We had one in November. This is the third time they've used language like this this season. So that's an indication for folks watching at home for viewers, for residents to make sure they are prepared for an event like this. Yeah. The language really gets your attention, that's for sure. It does. All right. Melissa Stephanie, hang tight. We want to bring in NBC 4's Alex Rozier. We saw his live shot not too long ago, where he was making his way to the Palisades. And, Alex, I believe you have some LAUSD school busses in your sho. Yeah. We are. It's been gridlock for more than a mile here in Pacific Palisades. We are on Sunset Boulevard right now, and I just reached out to our producers, because you can see that there are a string of LAUSD busses here that are heading in the direction that we are here. Northwest really, on Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades. So there's just a variety of factors here. Obviously, this fast moving wildfire is ongoing. It happens in the middle of a workday, in the middle of a school day. You have people who are now leaving their jobs, presumably to head to try to head back into their neighborhood and get any important documents that they may have. And you have people that are leaving at the same time. So we've been monitoring. But if you live in this area, this is what you're seeing right now on the roadways again, Sunset Boulevard, what's complicating it. And you might be able to hear this right now too, is that we have a LAPD officer. You have all these emergency vehicles that are consistently driving past you. So and on the right side of your screen, you might be able to see a number of kids and families that are walking up the hill right now. So a lot happening here in the Palisades and, and a variety of people and families that are responding to this massive fire that we're watching right in front of us, very fast moving guys. We'll we'll send it back in to you. All right, Alex, we'll be touching base with you soon. Joining us on the phone is Pedro Salcedo, LAUSD deputy Superintendent. Pedro, thank you very much for joining us. Good afternoon. You know, we're hearing that schools are now being evacuated in the Pacific Palisades area because of this fire. Yeah. So we you know, we've been working very closely with the emergency. Operations center. The city has initiated. We were informed very, very early on about the initial fire that what's been taking place in the Palisades area as a precautionary measure, as well as now, the evacuation order that has taken place, we've evacuated Palisades Charter Elementary, Marc Marquez Charter Elementary School, as well as Paul Revere Charter Middle School. We sent out notifications, communications to families to ensure that they were aware that we were going to be relocating these particular school communities to other schools that are outside of the perimeter and provide a safe and learning environment for our students to continue that continuity of learning. But we also have provided a space for families to come and pick up their children, should they also be in an evacuation order and have to be responsive to that as well? So taking every measure to make sure that our schools are safe, as of yesterday, sent out communications districtwide to ensure that we were taking the steps to harden our our campuses when it comes to high winds, we have custodial and plant management staff walking our schools early today to make sure that any outdoor furniture, things that could become threatening objects as a result of high winds were removed from our outdoor areas. We've also implemented. Just a reduced activity for students when it comes to outdoor activities. Just to make sure that they aren't put in harm's way. I just want to be clear that none of these three schools are in danger at this point or within the fire zone. This is a precautionary measure to just relocate these students. Correct? Correct. Okay. All right. So parents, again, if they are within an evacuation zone, they can go to these outside locations to pick up their children. If not, then what we're talking about studies just continue for the day. These continue for the day at their relocated site. Okay. And if we want to forecast and look ahead to tomorrow, what will the game plan be for tomorrow? You know, it really depends on, you know, if there's any changing conditions. And that's part of just monitoring this overall environment when it comes to either high winds or storm related impacts in our schools, it's a case by case. And we also work with our regional emergency operations center really kind of dictate where we need a response, where we may need to relocate or close a school. All right, Pedro, thank you very much for your time. We do appreciate it. Thank you. All right. We want to get back out to Karma Dickerson. She's in the area monitoring the situation out there amongst many residents who are trying to evacuate. Karma. What are you now seeing? I'm seeing a lot of the same chaos along Palisades Drive as people are trying to get away from this fire that's burning up the hill, and it's resulted in just a mad dash to escape and try to give you an idea of what it is people are seeing out here. Take a look. This is our fire trucks trying to make it up the hill. And these are all the people trying to make it down. And you can see that there is smoke in pretty much every direction. You can see right along the ridgeline right there. You can see over the hillside. The fire has been burning down. That's Calvary Church, the fire. It looks like it has largely spared the church, but it's burning right up to the edge of it. You'll notice traffic is moving. Traffic has been taken over in both directions, heading down Palisades Drive. So everyone trying to get out. But it definitely means it's a struggle for the fire crews and resources trying to get back up. There was one area that I was trying to make my way towards. I'm going to see if I can get you there right now, because it indicates that the fire has actually made it down here to the ground level. Oh, it looks like there is something. There might be a vehicle on fire. Is that what it is? There is a car that's on fire. A vehicle on fire back there. So this has got to be people's worst nightmare as they are out here. Basically stuck in their cars, not able to move, that they will be caught in something like this. Karma you are wondering why there are no fire trucks attending to this is because no one can really get there at the moment. I just heard fire crews scrambling to try to get their. Michael. Yeah. Karma as we look live at your shot here right now, that car engulfed in flames and all that black smoke coming from it. You mentioned the word more than once. Chaos is an organized chaos in terms of traffic control. Or is this just a free for all for these folks trying to get down? It's a free for all. And I want to say that not critically, but just the reality of so many people trying to flee. There have been emergency responders trying to respond to it, but it seems like the chaos got out of control before crews were able to actually try to put some direction to the evacuation there. We have seen some City of Los Angeles parking enforcement trying to enforce a roadblock further down. But when it comes to people on either side of the street, people have been crossing the barrier here. I talked to one gentleman. I don't know if you remember just a few minutes ago when we were live, and he was asking me for help with his car because he blew a tire trying to pop over the median. And so trying to switch over into another lane of traffic. He blew a tire. Now his car is stuck. So it very much is people doing whatever it is they feel like they can do to get out of here safely. You will notice along the side of the road, a lot of cars have decided to park on the curb, trying to make sure that they could abandon their cars without impeding traffic. So that's something we're seeing people try to do. But a lot of people on foot trying to get out. And then of course, some people frantically trying to get up the hill, they've got family, they've got things they're concerned about and they're just trying to check on what how things are developing up there, you know? Karma so we're seeing these live images here of that car burning. I got to wonder if this was a vehicle that was trying to flee, that was trying to get out of the area, or just a car that was parked there. And then it goes to say that these embers are going in every which direction and could again land on, on a car. Absolutely. And I'm not quite sure how this fire started. I want to show you a little bit further up. If you'll recall earlier, I was saying I saw two palm trees burning. Those were the two palm trees I saw burning earlier. And it's notable that just below them is where we see the vehicle burning. I'm not sure if perhaps that Amber cars ended up landing on the car. I don't know how that happened, but that is pretty close and we are seeing this fire in the middle of the roadway. Meanwhile, on the hillside, there's no immediate fire there. There is some fire a little bit further back, but these winds are making spot fires all over the place as embers fall to the ground here. So it's pretty scary for people. The one thing this did was clear out this side of traffic, which is what first responders were hoping for, to get traffic back on that side so they could have a clear path up the hill. But again, you'll notice this is a car burning. There's no immediate fire apparatus trying to handle this right now. Yeah. Just so I'm clear, because you mentioned that traffic was flowing down the hill on both sides. What the shot we're looking at now is where traffic would typically be heading up the hill. Correct? Yes, exactly. Wow. Okay. Karma. And again, just for our viewers sake and of course, for me as well. Can you give us your location once again? Sure. I'm on Palisades Drive, just having recently turned off of sunset near Calvary Church. All right. Yeah. That gives us a good idea as to where people are and where this situation, the geography is important. Okay, so Karma any fire personnel about to or on the way to tend to this car that you see within your view? I do see, I see and hear some lights. That was a good year there, Michael. So I see the fire crew trying to make it up here. And this is the first time I've seen them been able to get this far. And again, it's not for lack of trying. They've just had traffic overtaken in both sides of the street. On my way up here, I was in a situation where I heard sheriff's sirens behind me. I heard fire sirens behind me. They were trying to move people. But if everyone has taken over both sides of the street, you can't really get people to move anywhere. Yeah, I'm sure there will be a major debriefing after this whole thing is over. As to what has happened here and how it got like this, as those fire crews try to make their way up the hill here, not only to tend to this car, but of course, the fire that's burning there in the Palisades. I mean, this is just daunting for anybody who's looking at this, for anybody who lives in this area. This is just I mean, the concern is great here for so many people. People who have family members want to bring in Chief Sam back here. Chief Karma touched on something that, again, is very important. Family members have other family members who live in this area, so they're trying to make their way to make sure that they're okay. And again, these could be people who are elderly or handicapped. You're right. But you can't get up right now. You're going to impede the response of firefighters. If you do try to do that right now, do not try to make access up here, because obviously this is a pretty wide street where people are coming down, say northbound, they're coming southbound. And it's cluttered. It's hard for fire department vehicles to get up that street. So you need to be cautious with this. And remember, this is a wide street. We have a lot of streets that are a lot more narrow. This in Los Angeles and throughout Southern California. Imagine if this was a tight street where it's kind of one way in, one way out, be a lot worse right now, and this is bad. This is reminiscent of the Oakland Hills fire where people were abandoning their vehicles. And we saw some catastrophic, you know, in results of that. So I can't say it enough. Get prepared. Now, if you're not in this area, it may be coming to a neighborhood near you or in your neighborhood today. You know, Chief Sam Karma hit on this and we saw evidence of it that you have, you know, one way in, one way out. However, the flow of traffic is all heading down the mountain, impeding those fire units from actually getting to not only this car fire, but the larger fire in general. Not not a good scene, of course, what happens in a situation like this and, you know, should there be some sort of traffic control at this point? Well, this is pretty chaotic right now. This is a very dynamic situation. And I know LAPD and their surrounding law enforcement are doing the best they can. But this is a pretty very significant event with strong winds fueling these fires and resources coming in and out. So I think all I can say right now is I know everybody is doing the best they can, and we just have to be patient. Keep your calm and let firefighters do their job and follow directions. All right. But again, we want to reiterate that if you feel that threat evacuate. Don't wait until you're told to evacuate. Gather all of those belongings and get out calmly, as calm as you can. All right, chief Sam, as always, we'll let you drink some water. Take a little break here. We want to bring in now. Meteorologist Melissa Magee. And again, we Four, 43 1300. Again, that number is 213443 1300 if you want to get some information. But at this point, I believe a lot of parents have already gone and picked up their kids. You know, out of that concern. All right. So we split screened exactly what's happening here in Palisades. Pacific Palisades here for you. We want to bring in our fire expert once again. Chief Sam DiGiovanna. Chief Sam, you've been with us all morning long. Now into the afternoon, and we continue to see the plume of black smoke. Again, we've seen those miraculous water drops here from those super scoopers again. But the acreage continues to grow from two acres. When we first started to 20, when we got you on the line, 20 plus, now we're well over 200 acres. Yeah. And it doesn't look like there's much relief in sight. Michael, this thing is moving quickly. And if you look to the shot to the left earlier, it almost looked like nighttime. It was so dark. You've got a little bit of the wind that pushed the smoke down to the ground. Even more so. But earlier it looked like it's night. So just let's go back to the highway patrol officer talking about driving conditions. You have obscured conditions from the smoke, power outages. So traffic signals are out. You've got a lot of people on the roads trying to get out of here. So you got to use real big caution on this. And not only for the fire, but as Stephanie brought up earlier, you know, and Melissa, this is not just a fire concern. You have downed trees and power lines, a lot of problems that are going to be associated with this other than the fire. So we all need to use caution right now. Chief Sam, you mentioned something downed power lines. If somebody were to come across a downed power line, let's talk about what they should avoid doing and what they should do. Avoid it. Treat all any downed lines at all as if they're energized, because they may be. Stay away from them and report it. Do not touch them and do not even go near them because they even have static electricity that could shock you, or you don't know what that line is going to do. It may arc, spark and move towards you, so just stay away from it. All right. Chief Sam, you spoke of earlier some evacuations that in fact, we are now getting confirmation here from the LAPD. And if we can put you on hold here for a second, I'll go over those to let our viewers know exactly what we're talking about here. Again, this fire is just over 200 acres with structures under immediate threat. There are now mandatory evacuation orders in place which fall within the what they call the polygon, described as northeast is the Merrimac Road west to Topanga Canyon Boulevard and south to PCH. Now the Westwood Recreation Center is open now as an evacuation center, and they Annabelle from what I'm reading here, they will accept small animals. I know you had a question about that earlier with the council member Traci Park. And again, this is all coming from the LAFD. So those evacuation orders that we knew were on the way are now in place. Okay. Yeah, that is some good information to know. But again, we also want to keep in mind that there are some elderly people who live in these areas, people who need assistance. So Chief Sam, we were talking about this check on your neighbors also. Know you have neighbors or people that may be handicapped. Please check on them. Make sure that they're okay and you may have to assist them with evacuation. All right, chief Sam, we want to once again get back to our meteorologist here in the first Alert Weather Center to give us an update. We were sort of timing these winds out what to expect here later this afternoon and into the overnight hours. And, Melissa, you guys got all the technology, all the radars necessary and possible to sort of track this for our viewers. Yeah for sure Michael, as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon, the winds are going to strengthen. We're already seeing that right now close to the Santa Monica mountains here. Thank you so much, Stephanie. Stephanie is really prepping some of the graphics and we're working hand in hand telling you the story with the Santa Ana Wind event. This is significant, the strongest one of the season. So as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon, lunchtime and beyond, you can see those winds ranging anywhere from 20mph at the coast as we head inland, gusting up to 32mph even in the Antelope Valley. But right in between, sandwiched in between, you can see a lot of purple and light purple or pink on your screen. That's wind ranging anywhere from about 40 to 60mph. So even as we go throughout the rest of, that's not the height of the event, by the way, as we go throughout the rest of tonight, I would say about nine, 10:00 tonight, during the overnight hours, the winds will only intensify. We're stopping it here at midnight. You can see for Los Angeles, you've got winds up to 44mph. You would say in a typical Santa Ana event, that's not really much of a big deal. But for the Basin, it is because this is an area that is typically wind sheltered. We don't typically see the winds coming down through the Basin through the coast as well. It's right through areas in the Santa Clarita Valley, through portions of Ventura County, out across areas in the IE not the case with this situation, which is why the National Weather Service is using language like particularly dangerous situation. This is the third time they've said that this season. And we're seeing because of the images on your left, the reason why we'll continue to advance this, you can see as we wake up tomorrow morning. Allow extra time for the commute. Look at this in Malibu winds up to 50mph. We've got gusts close to Ojai up to 30. Then you move across areas in the IE Orange County. You've got an Irvine winds up to 40mph. But if you take your I just move it just to the east. There's a blob of red that's winds ranging anywhere from about 60 to 70mph. So this is a concern as we go throughout the rest of tonight as we're tracking the winds and a dangerous situation with the winds. Just look at those trees, those palm trees blowing as we're watching these live pictures come up to the left of our screen here. So again we're talking about the challenge it is now for firefighters dealing with this blaze. But then also dealing with these extreme wind gusts. Very concerning. And this is only going to make the battle that much harder for them. And for anybody who's trying to evacuate this area. Again, we just want to just remind you all, grab those kids and just leave, especially if you feel that threat there. You know, we actually have gotten and I believe this might be the live shot and please, somebody in the booth. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we had video of a home that was damaged here, and I believe it's on a Lockman Lane. It again, Lockman Lane, this is about three miles from the Getty Villa. From what I understand here. So again, evidence of how quickly this fire moves, how devastating this fire has been. And again, we continue to monitor exactly what is happening here in these neighborhoods in the Pacific Palisades. At least 200 acres burned here so far. And again, with what our meteorologists are telling us at this point, this is what we're in the midst of now seems to be the lighter of what we're going to experience here in terms of winds. Right. And this is only going to get worse, is what we're hearing from our meteorologists. So again, very concerning dangerous situations out there. And that's why we've been talking so much with Chief Sam about how you need to prepare. Now, take advantage of this and prepare, especially if you're not in this particular area in the Pacific Palisades area where you should just evacuate. But if you're in another area, just prepare and just get ready to, you know, evacuate if need be. Yeah. If you speaking of evacuations here, we want to bring on the phone now. David Hansen, who is visiting his mother, who lives near the fire. And David, from what we understand, you're helping your mom evacuate. Correct? She lives on in the Palisades Village subset of the Palisades Highlands, which is right across a fire road from Lockman Lane in the top of Carmel. And the fire road was actually on fire. They've been actively dousing it using helicopters with water to try to get it out, because it was one of the two main. Exit routes for the thousands of residents in the Palisades Highlands. Hey, David, how long did it take you to get to your mom? So because I'm born and raised here and I received confirmation from people that the bottom of Palisades Drive by sunset near Calvary School, not necessarily the school itself, but the road there was on fire some of the brush debris around it. So they were not letting people up. The main artery of Palisades Drive. But I knew whenever there was a fire, security, police and fire opened this back fire road at the top of Lockman. And I literally happened to get there right as the flames started hitting the road, but was able to get through, and I saw driving up Lockman and Carmel, which is above Bienvenida and Sunset Boulevard. There were crews actively working on homes on Lockman that were on fire, and maybe even a home or two on Carmel. And higher up in the Highlands, on the edge of the Santa Monica mountains, there's a street called Chastain in the far right corner of the Palisades Highlands, where there's a number of crews. But the wind right now, the Santa Ana's are strongly blowing towards the ocean and away from most of the homes in the Highlands. So hopefully if the wind stays this way, it's okay, but it is blowing towards homes on Lockman and Carmel. You know, David, I got I got to point this out. You seem relatively calm and when you're speaking with us here right now, I don't know if I would be as calm. I don't know if it's an actor, you really don't know what's going on here, but how are you and how are how is your mother? She's doing great. She's 78.5 years old. She's retired. She broke her back a few years ago, so she moves a little slow, even with physical therapy. She's got a little dog. And my sister, who resides in Malibu right now, we couldn't get Ahold of her, and I just happened to already be on the road in Sunset Boulevard near Pacific Palisades. And she was following our friends out of the neighborhood, down Palisades Drive. And our friend's cell phone worked, contacted me and said, hey, there's a fire at the bottom of Palisades Drive. We have to turn back up and go back up to the Highlands. And I knew about this other road which I was able to cross, which they are now temporarily preventing cars from driving on, given an active fire and fire drops on top of it. David, what's the game plan now? And I'm so glad that you you're with your mom. You guys are. You were able to get her out safely. What's the game plan now for you guys and for your mom? So we're watching the helicopters and my hope is one of the two main arteries to the Palisades Highlands. The main Palisades Drive, or the fire road is cleared for access, but we keep seeing on the radar in front of her house. Cars drive towards the fire road and turn around. Because the fire crews are actively working on the fire road as we speak. All right, David, so you have your mom when you live in what I would consider a vulnerable neighborhood like this. And you know what we just saw in Malibu not too long ago? You know, we always talk about being proactive, being, you know, being prepared. Is mom prepared? She ready? Set, go. We were worried that the power would get cut out. There's still power in the neighborhood and there's still cell reception and internet. Unbelievable. But most of the wires up here are underground because it was a community predominantly built. Really the upper part in the 1980s. So there's not a lot of above ground wires up here, which is great. How I'm blessed to be talking to you right now, but we're hoping shortly we get the word that we can drive out. But I know all the neighbors here have done pretty good weed abatement and everything else, and there was just a fire here about a week or two ago at the top of Chastain, set off by some fireworks. It was actually, I think, a 1 or 2 in the morning on New Year's morning on January 1st, or I believe was when it occurred. Yeah. David, what's a neighborhood like where your mom lives? I mean, are there other people who are elderly there who live in that area? Yeah, and we've seen some people that definitely probably aren't capable to drive. And we've seen their neighbors, their kids, or even perhaps, you know, their housekeeper or gardener drive. Some people out. And a few of us were knocking on some of the neighbors doors to make sure that they were okay, that they got out. And but right now, we're kind of in a wait and hold the people here just because we're waiting for the roads to clear so that we know we can get out. And but the crews seem to be doing a great job. And right now the Highlands is looking relatively good, minus the, I would call it the south edge of the Palisades Highlands. Santa Monica mountain rim. Wow. You know, David, we're actually looking at some of the video that you provided to us here. Can you describe the scene? This is a home on your mother's street. That's that's on fire. Yeah. The homes totally fine. But the fire initially was directly across the street from our house, and probably 100 or 200 yards beyond the homes across the street from here. So that's Upper Bienvenida. Above Lockman, kind of by Temescal State Park. Okay. Wow. I mean, again, we know that there that homes many homes have just been burned. We don't have an exact number yet. And we know that number will come to us later after, you know, the fire department goes out and just takes a number, a count of all of the homes that have been destroyed because of this fire. But it's so unfortunate to see these homes just go down because of these flames. And then, of course, we're seeing that this danger still is still there. It's still present, and we're only seeing the beginning of it. Michael, as our meteorologists have been telling us, David, before we let you go, it's good to know that the mom is okay. Your sister? You said she lives in Malibu. Was she at all a victim of the fire out there driving on PCH and stuck in traffic and couldn't move? And because a lot of people were probably trying to get here like me, but I was just blessed by God to be coming from a different direction, more towards 405 than Sunset Boulevard today, where I happened to be on the road shortly after the fire broke out and was able to come up the back fire road literally as it just caught fire. I was able to get through. You know, it's rare that, David, that we actually talk to somebody who's in the midst of, of an evacuation at this point. And again, we can say it until we're blue in the face about being prepared and being proactive. What would your message be for? For anyone who is either in a fire zone, danger zone or not, who happens just to be watching and says, hey, you know what, not so much. The first thing we told our mother to do when the fire broke out was get her car out of her garage, because a lot of garage doors don't have battery backup to open them, and a 70 year old woman back doesn't have the wherewithal to lift or roll up garage door herself. So we said, don't get the dog, don't get anything. Get your car in the driveway. Point it out so you can easily drive out. And then once she did that, she got her dog, she got her purse, and she was ready to go. All right. And by the way, your mom's name, if you don't mind, Doctor Billy Phelps, p h, Doctor Billy Phelps. All right. Yeah. So happy you are. Okay, Miss Phelps. And, David, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate you just talking to us about what you guys experienced. We are so, so happy that you guys were able to get out. Okay. All right. We want to bring in. If we can. Chief Sam DiGiovanna. Oh, I'm sorry. We're going to. My bad. I'm sorry. We're going to bring it. Karma Dickerson. Who is there in the Pacific Palisades? And again, as we split screen here, this as we get her live shot ready to go. Karma. You look like you're ready to go. We said the word chaos before there on where you were. If things smoothed out a little bit, they have. And you know what? Really smooth them down was the car fire we were talking to you about. You still see the remnants of it over my shoulder. I'll give you a better look. But things have gotten quiet. Nothing like a fire breaking out in the middle of a road where people are stuck that make people focus, listen to law enforcement and make people jump into action. And it was clear that that turned that into a priority for law enforcement. Want to give you an idea of a little bit of the panic and the chaos. Take a look right there. Let's see if I can show it to you. Those are shoes that on the side of the road we've seen keys abandoned and just beyond right there, if you see on the right hand side of your screen, the red sort of shuttle truck there, that was the car that was on fire. I talked to a gentleman who says he watched it unfold. He said it seemed like an ember landed on the windshield. He said the car was abandoned at the time that it caught fire, but an ember landed on the windshield. And then that fire erupted. Fire crews did make it here. They started actively, actively fighting the fire. They were also fighting that the fire that had made it into the palm trees above, which may well have been where that came from. But that's not all. We continue to see fires in this area. As a matter of fact, that looks like just beyond this Cybertruck, there's a fire that a firefighter is trying to put out right now. Oh, actually. Excuse me. It looks like someone filming the fire, not fighting the fire. But there are some flames beyond that Cybertruck. And just beyond us, we see rows and rows of abandoned cars. Now, just about ten minutes ago, before the previous car fire, these cars were full of people. Both lanes of traffic were blocked in each direction, but that really cleared out once the fire started breaking out on the road. We saw people leave their cars and essentially just make a run for their lives. So it doesn't look like the Cybertruck itself is on fire. But something beyond it certainly is burning. Take a look. That's Palisades Drive. All these cars. This is opposing traffic. These cars should be driving up the hill. But they were abandoned coming down the hill, giving you an idea of just why we've seen this gridlock. It does look like officials have put some roadblocks in place, and we're finally seeing some daylight here on the streets where emergency crews are able to get through to some extent. But if you take a look just beyond, you can see the fire on the hillside and the winds that are whipping. Can you hear them seeing the danger that still remains and people still little by little, trying to make it down that hillside. Yet Karma Dickerson they're setting the scene for us live there on Palisades Drive. And she said things have actually sort of excuse me, calmed down, smooth out here a bit from her last live shot here. Yeah. We want to bring in Chief Sam DiGiovanna. Chief, we see those flare ups there next to those cars. I mean, this is so concerning. Again, we could see another car catch on fire because of this. And then, of course, we've got those embers to deal with, with the winds being so erratic. Hello, chief. Chief, are you with us? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes. We got you now. Yeah, yeah, this could be palm fronds that are dropped. You know, that caught fire and are burning. But I want to go back to something, you know, let's we talk about this wind and topography driven. But it's also let's go back. We've had a lot of rain over the past few years. There's a lot of heavy fuels in these hillsides. And then let's not forget, these homes can actually become a fuel itself. If we go back to the coastal fire in May of 2022, in Orange County, it wasn't not a Santa Ana wind driven day. It was just a normal day with an ocean breeze going up a hill, caught a home on fire. That home spread to a home which ended up resulting in 20 homes destroyed. So sometimes you get the fuel. That's the problem. The topography, the wind. And then even homes are like fuel themselves that can spread from home to home. So again, we will say, Chief Sam, based on the conditions, based on the topography, we're not at all surprised about what we're seeing here and how it's all playing out. No, not at all. You know, and we talk about this, Michael, you know, even days when we did not have such strong winds and such a significant event like this, the danger living in Southern California, it's just here. Let's let's fast forward this. If the wind stops, let's say Friday or Saturday, the threat still remains high because everything now is even more dried out. We may not have the wind, but we certainly have the topography and the fuel. If a fire breaks out, the risk is going to remain with us for a while. We're going to need at least 5 to 7in of rain before the fuel moisture content in the hillsides change where it doesn't burn so easily. All right, Chief Sam, with that, we're going to pause, put you on pause here for just a second and remind our viewers here. It's now 1 p.m. And you're watching the NBC 4 News live, breaking coverage of the wildfire burning now in Pacific Palisades. Yeah, this is the latest information from LA fire. About 200 acres have burned so far. Evacuations have been ordered between Merrimac Road west to Topanga Canyon and south to PCH. The Westwood Recreation Center is now open for anyone and then evacuated. People who do need a place to go can go there. They also allow small animals, as we've been showing you all morning long and into the afternoon. We are seeing gridlock on PCH and on other major roadways as people try to get out of that area. The LA Fire Department now telling everyone head southbound on Palisades Drive to westbound sunset to southbound Pacific Coast Highway. As you can see, there's a significant loom up behind us. We're going to show you on the map where the fire is, where it's going, and what our evac concerns are. This is the Pacific Palisades Highland community. The fire is burning in a westward direction through here. So we want an evacuation warning for all of this area. That is going to be from Topanga Canyon here to the east, and from Rustic Canyon here to the west, is all going to be that area of an evacuation warning and be prepared for evacuation orders to come through. And the command post is going to be relocated down to Will Rogers Beach. Now, schools are being evacuated in the Pacific Palisades because of this fire. Here's a list for you. Palisades Charter Elementary School, Marquez Charter Elementary School students will be moved to Brentwood Elementary science magnet Paul Revere Charter Middle School students are being taken to University High School charter. That's right. And schools are communicating directly with those families. If you have any questions, you can call the LAUSD Family Hotline. That number is 213443 1300. All right. 102 here on a Tuesday, we want to bring in now on the phone, Margaret Stewart. She's with LA City Fire. Thank you for being with us here this afternoon. Okay. We seem to have lost communications there. We'll try to reestablish, but we want to bring in meteorologist Melissa Magee. And again we talked about this earlier. We'll continue to talk about it. You know what we're in the midst of now was just a little taste of what's to come here later this afternoon and into the overnight hours and now into tomorrow. Yeah. That's right. So this is a precursor and appetite, so to speak. The main event is happening as we go throughout the rest of tonight, overnight and into your Wednesday. Chief Sam talked about it. I want to elaborate just a little bit more on the points he was making in terms of topography and fuel and whether we've got the wildfire triangle. So these are essentially things that help fuel flames and spread fires more quickly. So the topography is the situation in terms of what you're seeing on the ground. The fuel is all of the brush, the trees, anything flying embers in the air as well. Things have been very dry here in Southern California. We've seen 0.16in of rain here in L.A. County. We should be closer to a little bit more than four inches at this point in our season. So the relative humidity will continue to drop as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon. And that's a problem because that will only help to spread fires more quickly because of the dry vegetation and low humidity on the ground. The other aspect in terms of the weather, the Santa Ana's, this is a significant Santa Ana wind event. The National Weather Service has called this life threatening. In some instances. It's also said this is particularly dangerous the third time they've used that type of language this season. So in terms of fires and the way fires spread, fire spread more rapidly uphill, you've got the rising heat from the flames rapidly preheating the fuel further up the slope, causing it to ignite more quickly. So for every 10 degrees of slope, it doubles the speed of the fire. The latest observation data, specifically with the Palisades fire. We've got the Palisades winds gusting up to 12mph. Santa Monica mountains. We've got gusts close to 50mph. And the issue is that as we go throughout the rest of tonight, the winds are only going to intensify. The relative humidity is going to drop, which will elevate the fire concern. Michael and Annabelle much for that. We want to touch base now with NBC 4's Alex Rozier. He's live. Alex, what are you seeing? Who are you with? What information do you have for us now? I don't know I don't have I've. Hey guys we are live right here. I want to give you a live look behind me and show you what we're seeing in this neighborhood. We're at Glen Haven. Lockman. The winds are intense. A large portion of this neighborhood has evacuated. But you can see the plume of smoke. A very residential neighborhood with hundreds of homes. There are schools nearby. Joining me now is Stuart, who had his mother in law, has lived here for 30 years. Got that big tanker dropping over there. Yeah, we're talking about the air drop that's happening right here. Stuart, tell us about your experience so far today. Well, it started out as a brush fire pretty far up the hill. But with the winds I had a feeling it was going to be driven down into all the neighborhoods. And it's starting to happen. This is Lockman, and it's burned sort of around this knoll for some reason. We're on a ridge, but it's burned down into Palisades Drive down into that canyon, and it's gone over to Bienvenida, down that canyon. So there's that school, Saint Matthews, over there, and Calvary on Palisades Drive. Both, I'm sure, are evacuated. So schools and homes impacted. A number of neighbors have already evacuated. What was your plan here? Right now? Just if there's like a little ember driven fire right around the house so that we can deal with. We'll do that. You know, if it if it fills in really hot and heavy, we're out of here, obviously. And you can likely hear the wind that's hitting our microphone right now. You said you've lived in the neighborhood for decades. Yeah. Has it ever gotten this close to your your family's homes? It's never gotten this close to. Yeah, not our house down by the village and not this home on Lockman. It's been in the Highlands. We lived there for a little while. It's been around, but it's never burned. This area, as you stand here, the wind is blowing. The smoke around us. What's going through your mind? It's. It's a strong wind. It's stronger than normal. So that's what drives the fire. There could be an ember a half mile away, and it catches the wind. And it lands over here and starts a whole new deal. I've seen several of them just start out out of nowhere, like a big plume took off over to our right. And it's like there goes another one. So if something like that were to land around us, we could put it out. That would be great. But if not, we'll get out of here. Stuart, thank you for your time. Stay safe out there. I wish the best for you and your family and your neighbor as yourself. I appreciate that, but we again, here at Lockman and Glen Haven watching this fast moving fire, the wind shifting in a variety of directions, smoke around us. And at many times we've seen flames on the hillside so close to several homes here at this point, from our vantage point where I'm standing, we have not seen any homes go up. A strong effort today already a coordinated approach by the fire department and the police department who are helping with the evacuations. We'll bring you the latest as we have it, guys. We'll send it back in to you. Well, Alex, we can really hear that wind just whipping through that particular area. And then we could also hear, I don't know if you picked up on it, Michael, but the Stuart was out of breath, you know, so it just goes to say how heavy the smoke is because of the fire. Yeah. Stuart, they're being interviewed by Alex. This is at the intersection of Lockman and Glen Haven. Stuart out there helping his mother in law. And he's lived in different parts of the Palisades. He says. But it's never burned in this particular area. And he said those winds are stronger than ever. And we picked it up there on Alex's mic for sure. All right. So we want to bring Chief Sam back in. And Chief Sam, it's one thing to talk about the winds, but it's a whole other animal to actually hear those winds via that microphone. Yeah, they are blowing strong. And as the meteorologist reported, you know, it's only going to increase. And the threat and the danger and even the spread of this fire is going to increase due to this wind. Chief Sam, we saw Stuart. He's helping his mother in law out of that neighborhood. We've also spoken to someone who was helping his mother get out of the neighborhood. And something that he told his mother, which I thought was interesting. You know, forget about the animals. Forget about the dog. Open your garage because you don't know if power is going to go out. And that garage door may not open because it's all power based. Get the car out and point it in direction of the street. Those were the instructions, not only David, but his sister gave to their mother. Same advice you would likely give. You know, as a firefighter. Absolutely. But if you're getting to the point where you're going to have to pull your car out, back it out, that's a good time to evacuate. Don't wait until it's too late. If you feel that you need to evacuate, get yourself prepared. You know there's different stages of preparedness, but if you feel that you're going to have to leave soon and you want to move your car out, go ahead and leave your belongings. Yeah. And in all fairness, he was there to help his mother. So these were the initial steps as he was making his way up to get to his mother's property. So, you know, just just providing the instruction. And again, he says his mother and her neighbors always seem to be prepared. Yeah. And he did. He did the right thing. And I'm saying this right now to people in this particular area do that. But if you feel that you need to leave, then leave. This is a good time to do it. Don't wait. We know if you're in the path of this fire, the direction this is going to the west. Maybe this is a good time to just get your belongings, get your pet, go to a friend's house or an evacuation shelter and right this out. Don't wait until it's too late. Chief, you know, when we were looking at Karma Dickerson shot, we saw a lot of abandoned cars there. I mean, that's got to even that's got to add to the challenge. Now that firefighters are facing is that the roads are getting that much tighter because people are just abandoning their vehicles on the road there. Yeah, it's very congested. And then you have a lot of cars and sometimes people will just leave the car right in the middle of the road. Some of them have pulled off on the side of the curb. That helps for access and egress. But again, this is why it's important to leave now. You don't want to have this. We know this is coming. This is coming. So to the communities to the west of this, that if you're in the path of this fire, leave now so that you can get out safely and not have to abandon your car and walk. You know, chief, you're talking about, if you're in the path of this fire. But how do you necessarily know that? Because you could be fine and the fire could be, you know, a few miles away, for instance, in a completely different direction. You think you're fine, but then all of a sudden an ember will come flying and maybe hit your neighborhood. I mean, so how is this person really supposed to know if you're in danger there? Well, if you're in the hillside areas and you know this fire is burning and you may be two, three, four miles away, that's a that should register in your mind. The winds are blowing this strong. It's coming this direction. Just go ahead and leave. I know it sounds so simple. And really, if you follow that advice, it really is. Do not wait until it's too late. You know, Chief Sam. Sadly, you know, a lot of these homeowners are at a disadvantage because this fire broke out. While most folks are, you know, at work, if you will, their children are in school. So, you know, you leave your house thinking you're going to return home to it, or at least return to your neighborhood. And this is happening. You're so vulnerable you don't know what to do. In fact, you feel helpless at this point. Yeah, you do. And that's why we talked about this. And you know, a lot as of lately. Prepare your home. Now think about before you leave for work or you run errands. What happens if a fire does break out and I'm not able to get back into my neighborhood or to my house? Just start thinking. Having a plan ahead of time is key for everything. Plan ahead. All right, Chief Sam. And with that, if we can just keep you on the line. And if we can, can we bring in a meteorologist? Melissa Magee, you spoke about this, and this has really stuck at the forefront of my brain here. Yeah, this this wind pattern which ebbs and flows and, you know, from 6 to 8 tonight we're going to see wind gusts of, what, 35 miles an hour from 8 to 10, 44. And then tomorrow morning they ramp back up once again. Right. And that was just for the Basin, Michael. I mean, they're going to get stronger for the coast, for valleys, the inland valleys, the foothills and the mountains. So overall, we're calling for winds for the coast and the valleys. Anywhere from 60 to 70mph. The mountains can have winds anywhere from 65 to 80mph. Some isolated spots in our mountain communities could have gusts near 100mph. And like Chief Sam was talking about, we're dealing with the Santa Ana's. This is erratic fire behavior. And unfortunately, watching the Palisades, Palisades fire, it serves as a reminder. If you are in one of these fire zones or in an area that's prone to seeing wildfires, make sure you have that ready, set, go plan in place. So what does that really mean? Ready is creating and maintaining defensible space. Clearly in the Palisades fire, as they are acting now, that's not something that they can do. But this is a reminder for other communities to make sure that they are prepared. Harden your home against any flying embers set is to make sure you're well prepared in advance of the wildfire. Make sure you have that emergency supply kit and know your evacuation route. And then go is go when it's time to go. So we've got red flag warnings that are going to stay up as we go throughout the rest of our Thursday guys. So this is an extended event as we're dealing with long duration Santa Ana winds moving in across Southern California, and the winds will continue to get stronger. Santa Monica mountains. They've got winds gusting up to 60mph. And as we're watching the images on the right of your screen, the firefighters tackle the flames of what looks like a structure. Now you're dealing with flying embers and hot spots. So this is a concern. And this is why we say erratic wind behavior because we're dealing with a specific fire. And on top of that fire you've got flames that are burning in between those ho. You know, Melissa you talk about these, you know, fire prone areas and how, you know, preparation and being proactive is key. But we're now seeing wind gusts in these wind sheltered areas. And we typically don't see winds like this in these areas. So those folks are now at risk to some degree. Exactly. So we're talking about areas like Altadena, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills, areas in Pasadena that are typically not going to see a lot of these strong winds that we see through the canyons and passes. For example, the Cajon Pass, the Banning Pass, that's an area that you know is prone to seeing strong winds. Same thing up across areas in the IE up through Fontana, San Bernardino County, San Fernando Valley, the Santa Clarita Valley. So this is why it's particularly stressful here in Southern California right now, because you've got the winds and the wind will help to fuel the erratic behavior of the fire, you know, and I'm so glad that you're talking about how long this red flag warning is going to last. We've got it until 6 p.m. On Thursday. Right. So we're we're seeing these images live images of the fire here. But this is a reminder for anybody else who lives elsewhere just to be ready to go as well. Because yes, it's in this neighborhood right now in the Pacific Palisades area, but it could very well go to the Inland Empire. We could be talking about the Inland Empire, God forbid, later on. Right? Right. Or in the OC. I mean, we are talking about so many different areas that are affected by these gusts, right? So the height of the wind gusts. Annabelle and Michael, that's going to be later on tonight and into your Wednesday. We'll have to wait and see if the National Weather Service extends any of these high wind warnings or wind watches that are posted here in Southern California. But that's where we're anticipating those strong winds, increased wind across our region. On top of that, even when the strongest winds exit Southern California, it is still going to be dry. So that's where that red flag warning comes in. And that has been extended now until 6 p.m. On Thursday because of the Santa Ana's, because of the low relative humidity, relative humidity. Pardon me. This will certainly help to elevate and spread fires quickly. And we're starting to see that this afternoon. I got one more question for you. You got it. I know you're working overtime over here, but for you. Yeah. You know, you mentioned earlier and correct me if I'm wrong with with this number here, but you said it so far. We should have at least experienced four inches of rain. Yes. And we have not at least. And this is just for LA County. LA County. Okay, so we should see at least four inches of rain at this point in our water year. Our water year starts October 1st and it continues on. We've only seen a little bit more than a 10th of an inch of rain here in Los Angeles. So we've got a deficit specifically of 3.40in of rain. The reason that is taking place is that all of the storms this season have been up across the Pacific Northwest. We've been talking about all of that rain and snow in Washington and Oregon, and we're not seeing any of that activity move down here in Southern California. All we need is one storm to change all of that. But as of now, it's been months, at least six months where things have been dry here in LA County. All right, Melissa, as always, we're going to keep you on deck here. I'm here for you. All right. Thank you. Appreciate that. All right. We want to bring in Chief Sam back here. Chief, you know, Melissa was talking about this. This plan or this. Ready, set. Go plan. What does that include? And we should probably talk about, you know, families, people who have families in scenarios like this, you leave for work, you drop off the kids at school, they also everybody needs to have a plan in the event of you're right and you have to practice that plan, just like we drill with the fire department, just like exit drills in the home during fire safety in your home, you have to have a plan, put it together, communicate it with your family members, and practice it. It's it. But you know, the thing is, and sadly, most people feel it will never happen to them. And it does. Yeah. And that's therein lies the problem really quickly, said Chief Sam. Melissa hit on it four inches of rain. We should have so far this year. During our water year, which started in October, we've only had about a 10th of an inch. This adds, obviously, to the challenge that firefighters have. So when they see numbers, dismal numbers like this, what what are firefighters thinking? What is the game plan? How do things change? Well, you know, we know living in Southern California, this is what happens, as I mentioned earlier, you know, several years ago, we had a whole lot of rain. Then it stopped. So the fuel in the hillsides grew tremendously. Now it's all dry and even more drier with no rain. We know we contend with this. Our game plan is just what we do. We plan, we prepare and train for events like this. And here they are. They're right on our doorstep right now. So doing just what they're doing, I'm going to give kudos to all the firefighters out there from LA city, LA County, Verdugo, the South Bay cities, the fire departments that have brought in from Northern California. They're doing a tremendous job under these circumstances right now. I know I've been on these fires. This is some of the most challenging work that can be done. And, chief, you know, to that point, yes, kudos to them. We know they're heroes. They've been preparing for this. As we've mentioned earlier, they had days to prepare for this. I mean, they got a call, I'm sure, alerting them that they were going to be coming down to assist those firefighters from Northern California. How? I mean, this is around the clock. I mean, none of these firefighters are going to be taking breaks. No, they won't. And, you know, the thing too is, is this is one fire. This fire may go out here hopefully soon. You know, it's not it's going to take a little bit a while and they're going to be here. This is they're going to be here for a few days. But then some of them will end up going to another fire. So we get deployed from one fire to another. So I'm going to give them kudos. Again. I can't give it enough. You know, Chief Sam, we no longer have a. I guess a traditional fire season here in Southern California. But typically we would be out of fire season as of now. Correct me if I'm wrong. No, you're right. I mean, normally traditionally we will, but we have seen where this has happened. I mentioned this earlier. You know, January of 2014, we had the Kobe fire in Glendora that burned six homes in 2017, the Thomas Fire started in December and burned all the way into January of 2018. That fire burned 280,000 acres and destroyed over 1000 structures. So we really are year round fire season chief. Sam, you know, we're looking at these images again. We're seeing that blaze there. How does this differ from the mountain fire? Again, the mountain fire was also wind driven. And that we that when we had in what November. Yeah. You know, it's just, you know the proximity of homes, you know, to say how does it differ. Well it's just the different terrain, the slope, the topography, the mountain fire. We saw that burn down into lower lying areas that were not even in the hillside areas. And that's what our my point earlier, you know, these homes can be we saw this in Santa Rosa years ago where towns that weren't even near the foothills that burned down just because of the wind. So, you know, there's challenges. Every community has a unique set of challenges due to the number of homes in the area, topography, access and egress. A lot of dynamics go with this. So. Yeah, you know, it's just, you know, you take it fire by fire and we're doing the best we can. All right. Chief Sam, we are going to again, we appreciate your insight. If you can just hold on really quickly. We want to get to our esteemed former colleague, Patrick Healy, who is on the phone with us here. Now, from what I understand. And Patrick. You're still well connected to us and we appreciate your time here this afternoon. Do we have Patrick? Okay. Something must have happened with the connection here. How about in the meantime, we touch base? Okay. Are you hearing me now? We got you, Patrick. Okay, good, good. Michael and Annabelle, first of all, thank you for your coverage of this. I'm watching with extreme alarm. This was my community for 40 years. I know the geography extremely well. From hiking in the hills behind the Palisades. And what I want to convey to our audience is the nature of the topography. There are several ridges and canyons, and only a slight shift in the wind can change the entire trajectory of this fire and threaten new communities and save other communities. So where the fire is burning above the highlands, above the Lockman Lane development, there are several ridges that converge there, and if the fire burns down one more ridge, it will threaten the main part of the Palisades. The main community at the base of Temescal Canyon. If the wind shifts more towards the west, the fire will move beyond the highlands and move into two communities called Castellammare and Miramar, and ultimately threaten Topanga Canyon and beyond. Topanga Canyon is the community of Malibu that is the big danger right now. Which way this wind shifts, which communities it will threaten, you know? And so that's why Topanga Canyon in now is one of those road closures, right? They typically close it because of the threat of a fire. And then, of course, we've seen it happen in Malibu fires. We saw with the Franklin fire, you know, also affected those homes, those residents who live in that area. So yeah, we are seeing the concern. We are seeing the traffic that it's causing. As many people try to evacuate that area. Patrick. Yeah, and that's the problem because the Palisades really has only two escape routes. Sunset Boulevard and going down to Pacific Coast Highway. Once you get down to the Coast Highway, you can go north or south, but of course it jams up very quickly. One thing the Palisades does have going for it, most of the areas that are up in the foothills, and after all, these are the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains. So this is there's some very rough terrain just above the Palisades, but most of the newer communities as well. David, the resident on Lockman Lane, was speaking to Alex a short while ago, pointed out it was developed mostly in the 70s, and so it conforms to the newer building codes for hillside communities. The roads are wider, it's easier for access for fire trucks, the homes are farther apart. They have fire resistant roofs, so there are a lot of precautions in place that say areas of Malibu and areas of the Hollywood Hills do not have. But, you know, all bets are off when you have a wind this severe. I might add that ordinarily, because of its location, kind of at the crook of Santa Monica Bay, the Palisades does not ordinarily get winds as severe as Malibu, which gets the winds coming directly from the north. But this is one of those exceptional days. Well, like 1978, which was the last year of a really horrific fire reached the Palisades. Those are the kinds of winds. All right, Patrick Healy, former NBC 4 reporter and good friend of ours. We appreciate your insight. Again, lived in the area for more than 40 years. And as Stuart said, if we had not too long ago, he said that he's lived in different parts of the Palisades, but it's never burned like this before. In fact, it has been interviewed by our very own Alex Rozier. Yeah. And actually, why don't we talk to Alex? He's in that area. Alex, we were looking at your shot there. We saw those winds just gusting over there. Yeah, the winds are definitely howling here in the area where we are in the Palisades. I'll give you a live look behind me. It's cleared a bit. Where we are at Glen Haven and Lockman Drive. I'll tell you that. We have been talking to neighbors for the most part. The people who live in this neighborhood, they've heeded the evacuation warnings, and they have left the neighborhood. There are a few people that still remain that continue to check on their property. About five minutes ago, flames came dangerously close to one home. And the person who lives inside the home, just down from where we're standing, he is still there right now. If we can show you that place right there. But the other part that I'm going to tell you, that's complicating things for people who may be still up here and trying to reach family, is that anybody who's traveled through this area before cell phone service is not good. So the folks ability to make phone calls, send text messages and get in contact with loved ones is challenging in many spots. We've ran into that same problem here since we've been covering this fire. But the winds, they have just been howling and dangerously close. Flames to many homes. And it's not just homes here. Also, schools in the neighborhood. As we were driving up earlier in our broadcast, you may have watched as we had several busses that were on the right side of where we were. People were trying to evacuate schools too, so a very tense situation, a fire that's burning in the middle of a workday, in the middle of a school day, and threatening many homes here in Pacific Palisades. Annabelle Michael, we'll send it back to you. Alex. So, Alex, you're in that area now, what seems to persist is obviously those winds. But if you can describe the scene for me in terms of what it was like when you got there, compared to what it's like now. You know, Michael, in the process of you asking that question, as I mentioned, the cell phone service is a bit spotty, so I lost it. If you can try one more time, I'll attempt to. I'll attempt to answer that. What's persists out there now obviously continues to be the winds. But I want to know if you could just sort of lay out, describe to us what the scene is like now versus when you first got to that neighborhood. And I believe you're at Lockman and, and Glen Haven. Yeah. You know, I think the scene is very different depending on just a couple of blocks. I mean, you can see this man who's standing on his roof right here. He's about the only person I've seen that remains in the neighborhood at Glen Haven and Lockman. There are very, very few people, I'll tell you, just a few blocks over less than a half mile away. Frantically, we saw many folks who were evacuating the neighborhood about a half hour ago. So it seems as many people are heeding the evacuation warnings and getting out of the Palisades right now. But there are a few who continue to remain. That steward who we heard from earlier. He said he was going to stick around and do his best protection as possible. But he said if it gets too bad, he's going to have to go and he's prepared to do that. So we're going to continue watching things here as as the story develops. I'd like to get the inside the head of that guy who's standing on that rooftop right now wondering what his plan is next. As you mentioned, Alex, most of those in that neighborhood have already evacuated. All right, Alex Rozier live for us there on Lockman and Glen Haven. Melissa Magee is here in the first Alert Weather Center. And again we're not surprised by the winds that we're seeing here right now. And hold on one second. Knocked it down. All right. So we're getting some more sound there for I believe from Stuart. But Melissa let's let's talk about what we're hearing and what we're seeing where Alex is right now. Right now Alex probably has winds anywhere from about 20mph to 52. If he's in and around that area. So that's a large range. But the latest observation data around that area, we rely on specific sites to give us the most accurate information. So in the Palisades right now we've got winds gusting close to 20mph. And in the Santa Monica mountains, those winds are up to 52mph. Something that I'm also noticing is that when we got on the air and we broke in telling you about the Palisades fire, relative humidity was anywhere from about 35 to 45%. It is dropping and it's dropping fast. So that's where that red flag warning comes in. So if you look at the map we have on your screen here and then look up above where the Palisades wording is, you see 28% there. And then Santa Monica mountains, relative humidity and at 33%, this will continue to drop as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon into tonight and into our Wednesday. So the drop in the relative humidity in combination with these very fast moving Santa Ana winds helps to accelerate fires like we're seeing right now. I want to take you into time because we're talking about what's happening now. The big question what's next? And specifically for the Palisades as we go throughout the rest of the evening into Wednesday, I want to show you what's going on. And we talked about there are going to be some ebbs and flows in terms of the weather, the weather pattern and the track and strength of the wind. So as we go throughout the evening, we'll have winds anywhere from 6 p.m. Tonight to 8 p.m. Tonight, ranging anywhere from 34 to 36mph. So that's a little lighter than what we're currently seeing. But then, as we've been saying late tonight, I'd say between 9 and 10:00 tonight, those winds ramp up and our graphic is displaying that very nicely. Winds close to 44mph. They will weaken or wane overnight. And then they're going to pick up in intensity once again as we get into Wednesday morning. So that's where the red flag warning comes into play. Even though the most intense winds are going to be tonight into Wednesday, the red flag warning remains because as these Santa Ana's come in from the mountains with that strong northeasterly wind, they blow through the canyons and passes and in this case, all the way down to what are typically wind sheltered spots, the Basin and the coast. It dries out the atmosphere significantly. So we're starting to see extreme fire danger as we go throughout the rest of tonight. So let's time it out for other communities here in Southern California. For the rest of the afternoon, we'll have winds gusting anywhere from 20 to 50mph. Aside from the wildfires blowing debris, branches, leaves, trash flying on the freeways and some of our local communities downed trees, a big concern. Outages, power outages as well. Then once we get into tonight, the winds peak later on tonight, Michael, ranging anywhere from about 60 to 80mph, a little stronger for our mountain spots. And then Wednesday morning, like I mentioned, there's another burst of wind coming in from Mother Nature. So a slower morning commute. This is one of those situations where high profile vehicles will be impacted. If you're on the freeways, like the 118, the 210, for example, and then watching these firefighters on the left looking at the imagery, now they're putting out what looks like structure fires. So you've got the Santa Ana winds that are carrying these flames and these embers that are clearly traveling in some spots more than a mile. So not only do you have to deal with containment with the actual fire, you've got structure fires on top of that, or at least spot fires. I should say, in between unburned fuel in these spot fires, we've seen evidence of those spot fires early on during our coverage. And Melissa, you mentioned that the peak of the wind in the Palisades, because we're focused obviously on that with the fire that's currently burning 44mph tonight at ten. Right, right. But I look at these numbers, 60 to 80mph along the coast and mountains. So again, we're a significant jump in other parts of our region. Oh that's right. And that's why we say this is just the beginning. And it's erratic behavior. You know when you're in a fire, it kind of creates its own weather conditions where you have a rising heat and smoke and air, but you're going to have stronger winds in other parts as we go throughout the rest of tonight. And that's just a nice cue for you, so to speak. As we're saying, 44mph, it's likely going to be stronger in some spots, even for the Palisades. Later on this evening, we'll talk about those ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows in life, and whether that is for sure. Yes. All right, Melissa, if you can stand by, we want to bring in and if I'm not mistaken, we're going to bring in Camilla Rambaldi. Yes. Hi, Michael. Can you guys hear me? Okay, we got you. Camilla. Yeah. Give us the lay of the land. Where are you and what are you seeing? So I am due to service, so I'm giving you guys a not being able to do a FaceTime right now. But we are very. I'm. I'm close to Sunset Boulevard, up north Las Casas Avenue, and I was initially stuck in that gridlock of traffic on Sunset Boulevard, as we've been seeing. And right now one of the lanes has been shut down. So it's only going in one direction. So a lot of people just trying to figure out how to leave this area. I spoke to one woman earlier who was in the process of evacuating. She just didn't want to take that chance. So she just packed up her things and was just ready to go. But in this area, here in this neighborhood that I'm at on Las Casas Avenue, you can just see those embers flying. That wind picking up and just that plume of smoke surrounding this entire area. And I know earlier we were talking about that air quality. So that's definitely going to be impacting this neighborhood here. A lot of people, you know, wearing masks. And as they're walking around assessing the area because it's just very hard to breathe right now in this area, you know, Camilla you talked about how you were caught in that gridlock there on sunset. We had Karma also caught in some gridlock as well as Alex Rozier. What is the situation like now as as most of that been cleared up, or are we still in the midst of what you were experiencing earlier on? There is still a gridlock. There are right off Sunset Boulevard right now. They're just back to back traffic. People just stuck not being able to move. So I think there's a obviously a growing sense of frustration, people not being able to get out of this neighborhood. So right now everything appears to be at a standstill here, at least from what I see from my vantage point here on Sunset Boulevard and Las Casas Avenue, which is one of the streets here, that goes up to one of the neighborhoods in this area. Okay. We saw earlier during Karma, live shot, folks coming down the hill, coming out of the neighborhoods there. Are you seeing folks at all? You know, I if I recall, I saw somebody with a box in their hand, for example. Are you seeing any scenes like that where you are? Yes. Earlier. Not right now, but earlier. As I was driving, you know, through this, this neighborhood here, this stretch where I spoke to that homeowner who has lived here for over two decades, she was getting ready to leave, but just across the street from her, I saw several people coming out of their homes. I saw one person walking around with a with a bag. Just you can tell that people were, you know, figuring out their next steps on, you know, deciding to evacuate. So obviously that sense of urgency. All right. Camilla Rambaldi there for us. Again, if we can establish your face time at some point, we'd love to see what you're seeing again. You're at Las Casas Avenue there near sunset. We'll check back in with you here in just a bit. We want to bring in now if we can. First I want to mention here we split our screen here on the left. This is a live picture from our camera, compliments of our photojournalist Khalid Shabazz. This is the 1300 block of Lockman Lane. And we've had, you know, some different scenes and scenarios out, but it looks as if one home here on Lockman Lane, the 1300 block is damaged. You see that live shot there on the left of your screen, as well as some video that's just come into the NBC 4 newsroom there on the right. I believe we have our fire chief Sam DiGiovanna there, still on the line with us and Chief Sam, are you with us? Yes, sir. I'm here. All right. So I can't help but, you know, think about these these numbers that Melissa Magee our meteorologist, continues to give us in terms of what the situation will be like in terms of winds tonight in the Palisades area where we're actually in the midst of this fire, 200 plus acre fire. But within other regions of Southern California, 60 to 80 mile per hour wind gusts into Wednesday morning. Yeah. You know, that's a good point, Michael. And I'm shocked that we have not seen another fire of this magnitude break out with these winds. So I guess if there's any silver lining we can say that. But Melissa also brought up another good point about the flying debris, the leaves, needles and twigs. We may have a little lull tonight, but that's a good sign if you get home tonight in your area has not been impacted by a fire. Clean those up because I saw a lot of them in my neighborhood leaving the house this morning. There were leaves, needles, the branches everywhere in people's yards, around their house, on their rooftops. Those are those hotspots for embers. That's what we want to do to prevent something like this happening to your home. Yeah. You know, and, Chief Sam, we hit on this earlier about those flying embers and, you know, on any given day on any with any given fire, you know, we talk about a mile, mile and a half, perhaps with these strong winds and strong wind gusts. You've mentioned anywhere from 3 to 4, possibly even five miles from where the fire initiated. Yes. They can go up to five miles an hour. That's rare, but it can happen depending upon the wind. And with the winds forecasted for this evening, I would not be surprised if the fire breaks out with those kind of winds. We see that. Wow. All right. We talked about with Melissa those ebbs and flows with the winds. But again you just just stay focused. Remain focused as if this is going to be consistent because this will be a consistent pattern at least through Thursday. All right. Chief Sam, if you can hold on for one second, we want to bring in. And I mentioned him not too long ago. NBC 4 photojournalist Khalid Shabazz. Khalid, are you with us? I know we have Khalid's live shot there on the left side of your screen, going in and out. Okay, we're still trying to establish constant communication or consistent communication with Khalid. But. Michael, can you hear me? Yeah, I got you. Khalid, can you hear me? Let me reestablish the IFB. Okay? Why don't we do that? Khalid, you take care of what you need to take care of. And in the meantime, let's bring Chief Sam back in here right now. Chief. Sam, we still got you. Yeah. I'm here. All right, so, challenges for firefighters. We're having a challenge with communication with our crews out in the field. In this particular area, how do you guys circumvent that as firefighters there on the scene trying to put out the flames. Well we have some of the most high tech radio capabilities and communication systems out there. So that's really not the issue with them. Landline cell phones, those are going to be the problems. Yeah that's the main thing. But our communication systems are great. And again I'm going to go back to the robust mutual aid. And what the technology we have nowadays for these first responders. And. Communication. You know, it's advanced over, you know, very rapidly over the past few years. But Michael, let's go back to the ebb and flow. You can see that in the smoke on this fire. There are times when you see the smoke rising very, you know, high the wind is calmed for that moment. Then other times it goes horizontally right against the ground. That means the wind, you know, obviously strong wind gusts are coming. Very erratic winds creating erratic fire behavior. That's one of the big challenges for the firefighters right now. You know, as we attempt to reestablish our communication with Khalid there on the left, we certainly don't have a confirmed number of homes that have been damaged. But based on our coverage, based on what you've seen, what you've heard since this fire broke out, one structure is all we got thus far. Are you at all surprised by that number, chief Sam? Yes, I'm surprised, but until this calms down and we get a little bit more out of the dynamic state, and then we do damage assessment, we'll get a bigger number on this. But I am surprised. Kudos again. And I know, but I just could not be more proud of the firefighters out on these fires. And those are ready to go on a fire at any given moment. Right now, they're doing a tremendous job. They're incredible. All right. Chief Sam DiGiovanna, we appreciate you as always. And if I can just ask you once again to hold tight, can we bring in Melissa Magee here right now? And again, we talk about the valiant work of the firefighters out there on the front lines and the challenges they face. But again, what we're seeing in terms of weather is not going to get any better. Right? And you mentioned some areas that are not close to the Palisades that will likely have some issues. Michael, look at this. In San Bernardino we've got winds gusting up to 55mph. Santa Clarita, 52, Van Nuys winds gusting up to 40mph. And even in Santa Ana and Orange County winds up to 43mph. Then you look at the pictures on the left here. These live pictures coming in from the Palisades and the fire. You've got a lot of smoke, a lot of ash. So inerms of the conditions with the firefighters, they are dealing with all of that on the ground with the smoke, the debris, the ash. It's going to be a major challenge as we go throughout the rest of tonight. And they're only going to strengthen as well. So with the latest conditions close to the Palisades Fire, we've got winds anywhere from about 41mph out of the northeast there in the Santa Monica mountains and gusting up to 58mph. So they're really starting to strengthen. So you've got all of these northeasterly winds coming from the mountains, through the canyons and passes all the way down to the coast, and it's blowing that smoke around. And it's also blowing the flames around, which is why this is a concern in terms of dealing with the wildfire triangle and the topography. That's the fuel, the grass, the trees, the fuel, as well as dry conditions. And then we've got weather. The Santa Ana's helped to. Exacerbate or grow the flames of the fire tremendously. So this is a big concern. So as we go throughout the rest of the evening and into our Wednesday, the winds are going to pick up for the Palisades. But really everybody also, I want to show you the relative humidity because we've been talking about how this will continue to lower. We've got relative humidity in the teens and these will likely drop even lower as we go throughout the overnight hours and into our Wednesday, which is why this red flag warning is a bit of a concern. But looking at the flames on the left, it really looks like the fire is really close to some of these homes here. And that's that's scary. Yeah, we see the fire protection there in these neighborhoods. And Colleen Williams joins me now here as we continue our coverage here of the Palisades Fire. And again, it doesn't look as if it's getting any better at this point. No. And you know, what is amazing is the fact that you can see this from almost anywhere in the city. I was driving in on the 134 and was stunned to look up over the Griffith Park Observatory and see this huge plume of smoke. I've seen the pictures from LAX today. You see a lot of white smoke. You see black smoke, but pretty much anywhere you're positioned in the city and the winds. Michael. Yeah, I you'll hit spots where the winds die down a little bit and then they pick right up. It's hard even keeping a small car on the road right now. Yeah. We talked about what the winds were like driving into work this morning. I saw, you know. Yes. It was breezy on the west side of L.A, but obviously I got over the hill and again, a much different scene, a much different scenario we want to bring in. I believe we've reestablished our connection there with Khalid Shabazz, our NBC 4 photojournalist. Khalid, are you with us? I'm with you, Michael. How are you? Hey, not too bad. I appreciate the images you continue to give us. I believe you're on the 1300, Michael. Yeah. I'm at Lockman Avenue. Lockman Lane. Correct. That's correct. I'm at 1377 Lockman Lane. And this home is completely a total loss. And right next to it, the home is still still here, but there's some damage. All pans, pan. There's some damage to this home right next to it at 1377 Lockman Lane. Also at 1408, there's some structural damage from fire as well. That Lockman Lane, 1408. They had me move back. As you can see the yellow tape, because there's a gas leak now. And as you can see, more fire trucks pulling up at this location. Khalid Colleen here. Can you describe the neighborhood? I mean, we saw the two houses you're talking about there. Is this just like a small cul de sac, or does it stretch up into the hills? There? Not at all. It's not a cul de sac, not this particular street. It stretches into the neighborhood. There's winding roads here that stretches around the neighborhood. There has been quite a few evacuations at this location and at this particular street. Now it's closed down. It seems like most most of the residents have been evacuated at this location. We want to explain to our viewers to the reason we don't hear from Khalid for a few seconds here. There's a long delay in getting his signal from Lockman Lane back to the studio here. Khalid, you mentioned that gas leak. Can you give us an idea of where that is and what firefighters are doing about it now? Yes. As you can see my picture here, this is the home. That's a total loss. This is the home where the gas leak is. I don't know if you can quite hear the gas, but it's a prominent sound. And so they have the yellow tape here for folks to be careful and to stay back just in case there's a, an explosion or anything like that. But this home here at 1377 Lockman is a complete loss as well as right now. There's a gas leak. Okay. So Khalid, we obviously want to make sure that you're not in peril here. If there's an active gas leak, I'm sure authorities would move you back even further if that were the case. But you mentioned something about 1408 Lockman Lane, perhaps another damaged or destroyed home in this neighborhood. That's correct. Michael. 1408. There's another structure fire. They were attacking it from the inside of the home. It didn't spread to the front exterior, but there's damage to the rear. In the rear of that location. Once again, I'm on a delay because the cell connectivity up here is very bad. As you can imagine, a lot of folks are making calls or on their cell phones and trying to reach loved ones up here. So the cell cell phone service is kind of kind of bad right now. Okay, so Khalid Shabazz there, photojournalist live for us there on the 1300 block of Lockman Lane where we've been told that one home destroyed, possibly caused by a gas leak and a fire crews are moving our crews back. And again, another home that is sustained damage there to the rear of the home. 1408 Lockman Lane. You know, Khalid was talking about that hissing. That's that's probably the sound that we heard. We weren't sure what it was. What we're looking at now is another home that appears to be on fire here. The this is at the Glen Haven, I believe, the 1000 block of Glen Haven. As you can see, firefighters doing some sort of structure protection. They're about to go into the backyard, obviously, to check out the situation there. But just to the right of the screen is where you see the fire. There. Okay. And we have with us on the phone as well, CHP Officer Luis Quintero. Officer, can you give us an idea of what you're doing at this point in terms of helping with the fire? Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for having me. At this point, we're CHP assistance has been requested to assist with a closure. Closures in the area of the Pacific Palisades area. We do have on the north end Pacific Coast Highway. We have all lanes closed at Los Flores Road. And on the south end we have all lanes closed. At Topanga Canyon Road. We are moving officers in the area. We're going to push people back even further south on the south end. So we're just advising people to stay out of the area. You won't be able to utilize Pacific Coast Highway at this. At this moment, you're going to have to use a 405 and the 101 as alternate routes. Officer, can you give us we talk about the PCH here. It's a major thoroughfare as we're looking at a house here. We're trying to get a location on this as well. Can you give us an idea of how far that stretch is on PCH, that it's closed down? It's not too far from the actual fire, which is why our officers are actually working on pushing that closure down south. To, I believe it's Temescal Canyon Road. There was actually also talks about closing all lanes on the ten freeway at fourth Street. That hasn't happened yet, but we are trying to push people back further south away from this fire and possibly closing those lanes of fourth Street on the ten freeway. Is that imminent? Perhaps. Or are we talking down the road here? This will probably be down the road. There was talks about doing that. However, fires are unpredictable at this point. We're still analyzing the situation. We're trying to get officers in positions as we speak. We're still analyzing to see what's going to happen. The high winds aren't helping the situation as well. However. We'll keep the people informed. All right. So you're advising people obviously to stay out of the area. There are road closures in place. Don't use PCH, only use the 405 and 101 at this point. And perhaps some closures here on the ten freeway at fourth Street. Again, we will stay up to date with you on that to get that that clarification. Officer, before you go, can you speak to the wind situation and the freeway system throughout Southern California right now? Any advice for people who who may be out driving? I know the wind comes and goes, but we're talking about gusts anywhere from 80 to 100 miles an hour. Are you advising truck drivers to pull over? What are you telling people? We're advising drivers to be aware. Be very careful of your driving, especially in these high wind conditions. Slow your speed. That's the biggest thing. And speed is a huge factor when it comes to traffic collisions or vehicles overturning. If you are driving a high profile vehicle, whether it's a caravan, a semi truck or just a big van, it's important that you reduce that speed, especially during the connector roads, and just be aware of flying debris as well. These high winds do tend to kick up trash and could cause a collision or a major incident. All right. Officer Luis Quintero with the CHP again we appreciate your time here this afternoon. I'm sure we'll lean back in on you here as the hour progresses. All right folks, we are continuing to monitor this fire here and keep a very close eye on this breaking news out of the Pacific Palisades here right now. I believe we still have Chief Sam DiGiovanna with us. Chief Sam, are you with us? Yes, sir. I'm here. We talk. About what? The officer there with the CHP. Those road closures on PCH, advising folks only to use the 405 and 101 and now possibly there's talk of some closures on the ten freeway. Yeah, there's, you know, need a lot of access for fire apparatus and equipment coming in. And. People need to have open pathways to escape. The access and egress is so important right now. So this is just going to escalate, Michael, you know, especially with the weather forecast with the winds increasing. And like I said earlier, you know, Colleen Chief Sam, we're going to put you on hold for just a moment. Again, apparently we are going back to where Khalid was just a moment ago. Our Karma Dickerson has arrived on scene as well. We'll get back to them in a moment. But, Chief Sam, when you see the smoke throughout the area, this is just the one fire you see white smoke, you see black smoke. Can you explain the significance for our viewers, please? Yeah, that's a good point, Colleen, because a lot of people think that just because you see white smoke in a brush fire, that there's water on it, it's going out like grassy fuels are going to put white smoke up. Heavier fuels that have oils in them. They're going to be a lot darker in the smoke. So you're going to see a combination of both. All right chief Sam, we now have Karma Dickerson back live on our scene here. Karma, you are exactly where Khalid was. We spoke with him not too long ago. Possible talk or talk of a gas leak here where you ar? Yes. We can hear that hissing just going on over my shoulder behind me. As a matter of fact, the first thing that happened is I got on scene as Khalid pulled me back a little bit and he said, stay clear, there's a gas leak, and firefighters are working to work around it. So you can imagine what a dangerous situation on top of a dangerous situation they have here on Lockman. We will show you the scene that we have here behind us. The sun is up, the sky is a little bit more clear, and it gives us a picture of the destruction that we have of a couple of homes here. The gas leak coming from the house over to the left. If you listen carefully, you can hear the difference between the gas leaking and the fire hoses going. They're doing their best to work around that. And so that's just a little bit of what's going on here along on the street. As you know, I came to you from Palisades Drive and trying to make my way here was pretty extraordinary, navigating all of the different roadblocks and trying to make my way up the road. I ultimately had to come through a fire road that honestly, when I got to it, there was so much smoke I didn't feel comfortable driving it, so had to hike part of the way in. And as I did that, I encountered many neighbors who were expressing their concerns and their fears because they feel that this is an area that it's not easy to get in and out of. And so when you have major thoroughfares like Palisades Drive or the Fire Lane inaccessible, they feel a little bit trapped. On the one hand, they're told to get out. On the other hand, there are not a lot of ways to safely do so. So met many people trying to navigate whether or not they should leave or stay or pass a roadblock, and what the best practice is at this point. Taking a look, it looks like that fire has flared up right here in the window. Again, there are firefighters on scene that are in that house trying to fight back those flames, but every time a wind gust comes up, that's another opportunity for those flames to just take over. More like what we're seeing right here would not have expected that. We thought this morning that. Yeah, absolutely. And this is the only not the only scene of this sort that I saw making my way through the neighborhood. I saw another home, at least three others that were in a really similar state, firefighters doing what they could. But fires in attics, fires in roofs, fires that were in backyards that were clearly starting to take over homes. And so on the other hand, you have homes that are completely untouched. So it's really a house to house situation. And that's how firefighters are treating that as a property by property approach to just trying to see what they can save and what they can protect at this point. All right. Karma Dickerson reporting live for us at the scene of that gas leak on Lockman Lane. Karma stand by. If it's safe. We'll get back to you in just a couple of minutes. Right now it's 2:00 and you are watching the NBC 4 news live, breaking coverage of this wildfire burning now in Pacific Palisades. Right now, this fire has burned at least 200 acres. That number we expect to be updated pretty soon. It could go up. We expect it to go up. We've seen several homes on fire there. People scrambling to get out of harm's way. Evacuation orders are now in effect. Schools are being evacuated in the Pacific Palisades because of this fire. The Palisades Charter Elementary School, Marquez Charter Elementary students will be moved to Brentwood Elementary science magnet, Paul Revere Charter Middle School students there are being taken to University High School. Charter schools are obviously in communication directly with those families. If you have any questions, you can call the LAUSD Family Hotline. That number is 213443. If we can pull down the prompter here just a second so I can read the rest of that number again. 213443 1300. Actor James Woods has been posting videos from his neighborhood on X. Here's what he had to say and I'm quoting here. We are blessed to have LA fire and police departments doing their job so well. We are safe and out. There are several elementary schools in the neighborhood there. There was an enormous community effort to evacuate the children safely. I cannot speak more highly of LA fire and LAPD, and certainly a lot of people feel that way when they see the job they've been doing on this fire and every other fire leading up to this. Absolutely. Well, I want to go now to NBC 4's Alex Rozier LA Live, I believe, Alex, you're there on Glen Haven. Yes, Michael, we are at Glen Haven and Lockman. I want to give you a live look behind us. The wind has just been going and it's moved from a slower wind to two big gusts here. Right now, you can see on the branches of that tree. Give you a little bit of a sense of what we're experiencing right now. But Stuart, who we earlier backyard of his mother in law's home and where we've been watching to the east here it's a bit tricky to see now in the smoke filled sky, but in the distance directly to the east there are a few homes, and over the last 10 to 15 minutes we have watched flames surround those homes and it's hard to make a distinction between if the home is on fire or if it's the yard directly behind the home. Either way, the homes are definitely threatened by the flames that continue to pop up here. We've been out here for the last about hour and a half, keeping an eye on the conditions here, and the wind is swirling and it's moving in every direction. And just when you think you might catch a break, it picks up once more. Let's walk you out to the street here to give you a sense of what we've been seeing in this neighborhood. And you can see a few cars, and that's what we've been seeing throughout the day, is that we've been seeing a couple of cars that have been leaving at a fast speed and that, but for the most part, it's quiet. People seem to have been heeding the evacuation warnings. But as I noted earlier, the thing about the situation that we've experienced to this point is that you go about a mile away and there was a frantic rush to evacuate. There was a line of cars that were headed out onto Pacific Coast Highway. But as you can see here, now, on Lockman, it's an empty road. We have seen a variety of L.A. County, LA city firefighters and police department as well, who have been out here to assist. So it's a coordinated effort, but it's a chaotic one right now because these winds are just so dangerous and putting so many people and homes at risk. Michael and Colleen, we'll send it back to you. You know, Alex, before you go, I want to let people know that the acreage on this fire has just been updated to 300 acres. At this point. But before we let you go, give me an idea again of the neighborhood you're in. What are the cross streets at this intersection? Yeah, we're at Glen Haven and Lockman. I heard our photographer, Khalid Shabazz, talk earlier about Lockman and how there was and Lockman right here. It's somewhere on this road. He was seen some homes that were immediately threatened. But we're at Glen Haven, and Lockman is where we're standing. Not far from a couple of schools, hundreds of homes. But as you can see in the distance, this is kind of what we've been seeing here are just these flames that have been popping up. They they go out, there'd be crews that take them down, and then it would come at a different spot. So it, you know, these, these homeowners that have opted to stick this out for now, they are they are waiting, watching anxiously. One man said who I spoke with said he's been here in the neighborhood for about 30 years and never has he seen flames get this close to the homes here at Glen Haven and Lofgren Lauren Carlini. Michael, back to you. All right, Alex, thank you. We have with us on the phone right now, Margaret Stewart. She's the Pio with LA fire. Thank you so much for joining us. We understand there's an update on the acreage. Up to 300 acres. Now, there is we do have a current estimate of 300 acres. However, it is being overflown as we speak. And so we anticipate a more accurate estimate once that serve is completed. Margaret, earlier we saw firefighters on the ground. We've seen the super scoopers out there. What other resources are being used to fight this fire? We have over 45 fire companies from LA city. We have additional resources from our surrounding neighboring agencies, and there are air assets from Cal Fire on scene. So it is a clearly a very large response. I don't have the numbers from the outside agencies, but we have over 200 LA city firefighters assigned to this incident, and we just want to continue emphasizing the need for everyone. The entire Pacific Palisades area, to heed the evacuation order. You can see the map on LAFD org. There's a yellow click here button and it will take you to the interactive map. But effectively, if you're in Pacific Palisades, you need to evacuate. LAPD has provided the evacuation route of South down Palisades Drive to Sunset West on sunset, which would be a right hand turn to PCH and then south on PCH. You know, Margaret, with the Franklin Fire in addition to the wind, there was a problem with all the smoke and the fact that the aerial assets couldn't even see where they were dropping. Are you using choppers? Are you running into the same problem with this one? Right now we have a fixed wing as the primary. We will use our helicopter resources when and where we can. I can't say specifically, you know, how much they're able to fly at the moment, but they will be in there dropping whenever they possibly can. Margaret, really quickly, obviously with nightfall, does the game plan change at all? And as those gusts increase later on tonight, you know, our tactics don't really change night or day. We're going to continue to, you know, to battle the fire in the same way our aircraft are able. Our helicopters, if they're able to fly, they're able to fly at night. So we can continue that process. It does obviously get trickier just in terms of being up in the rugged hills and, you know, the visibility. However, we will continue to fight, you know, fight this fire through night and day. You know, Margaret, you said they were overflying the area right now looking at acreage, is there any have you have you noticed any progress at all? I guess is what I'm trying to say. I know we're not talking containment. It's early for that. But is there any progress being made on this fir? You know, unfortunately, as you know, we're under extreme fire weather with significant gusting winds. So in terms of progress on extinguishing the fire, it's in the growth phase. And we are focusing on defending structures and ensuring that, you know, life and property is protected. But we won't be able to start making progress this early in the stage given the weather conditions. All right. Margaret Stewart there with us of LAFD. We appreciate it. I'm sure we'll speak with you here shortly. Thank you. Thank you. We just here, I guess the main nugget here out of all of this is there's been an increase in acreage. 300 acres is 300 acres now, up from 200. And the way it's moving at this point, it's likely it will get it will increase, obviously even bigger. We are getting a note here. And I believe we mentioned this before, that the LAPD is on tactical alert, which means all officers currently on duty, they will remain on duty until further notice. All right. Do we have Karma Dickerson with us right now? Let's go out to Karma Dickerson. She's live in that Lockman Lane area where we heard about that gas leak earlier. Karma. And that concern is still going on right now. We can hear the hissing firefighters nevertheless doing everything they can to try to get the fire behind me under control. You'll notice the winds are still whipping, and that means flames still coming from this home. Despite all of the energy and focus firefighters have put into trying to get it out. These winds, when they pick up, they're sending not just debris, but ash leaves everything and it really makes those flames reach the potential ember cast. The potential for that fire to spread. We have seen firefighters moving in and out of this area, law enforcement keeping an eye on things. One thing to note, this particular road is key here in this neighborhood, because it is right off the fire road, and it's one of the main ways in and out of the community. I had so many people stop and ask me, is the fire road open? Can we get through this area? And the answer is, while the road is open, you're going to encounter so many firefighters and hoses, heavy smoke, so many things blocking the roadway. It really isn't safe to try to make your way down because there isn't, you know, a safe way or very easily get stuck and impede the firefighting efforts. So my best advice would be, don't try to do it. Don't try to come that way down the fire road down Lockman. This is just one of the scenes that you'll encounter again, those flames flaring up. Now, this is an area where we haven't seen a lot of people out on the roads. Homeowners. There are still some people clearly in their homes, but most left as Khalid has been out here on the scene. He said as he arrived, he saw people doing everything they could to get out of the neighborhood. A lot of images of people evacuating. They have had some aircraft dropping water on top of the neighborhood, so they're fighting it from the air in this neighborhood. Also on the ground. And every single corner and block that you'll reach, you'll see a similar scenario with firefighters focusing on houses that have gotten flames, that have gotten heavy winds and may even have some of those additional hazards. For example, a gas leak and trying to isolate which properties need the most attention and focus their energies. There. All right. Karma Dickerson there live for us on the scene on Lockman Lane again, Carmen mentioned earlier that she saw at least three homes on her way up to Lockman Lane that had been destroyed. So again, she's using it as the backdrop of her live shot. There. One house that has seen some major, major damage, and you can see the winds are still very strong out there. You could hear Karma almost had trouble catching her breath. You can see the winds whipping around. To that end, we're going to call in our meteorologist, Melissa Magee to talk about the wind situation. Now, Melissa, earlier you said they're going to get even stronger as we move towards the evening. Oh, absolutely. Colleen and Michael, I mean, this is just the beginning. And a lot of communities, they're already stronger than what we're currently seeing in the Palisades. I want to show you the satellite radar imagery, or at least our visible satellite. And when we're talking about the winds, Karma was experiencing it firsthand. But I'm showing you what it looks like high up in the atmosphere. So if you look at Santa Monica, or at least the wording of Santa Monica, look off to the north and west, you can see what looks like a plume of smoke. That's not cloud formation. That is actually the smoke and the ash from the Palisades fire that we're tracking. And it's being driven by the Santa Ana winds. So you've got these northeasterly significant Santa Ana winds that are blowing from the northeast all the way down to the south and west, all the way down to the coast and to the ocean, specifically with the Palisades Fire and the weather conditions there. For those that are evacuating and for the firefighters, we've got winds gusting anywhere from 16mph in the Palisades, Santa Monica mountains. We've got winds gusting up to 52mph. And since we've been on the air since 11:00 and we broke in with the Palisades fire, you can see the relative humidity is starting to drop as well. We're down to 28% in the Palisades and 32% in the Santa Monica mountains. So you've got a wind driven fire that's really drying out the atmosphere with that strong northeasterly wind. And it's not just in the Palisades, it's everywhere. We've got relative humidity down into the teens for Lancaster, 17% in Van Nuys, and we've got relative humidity in Thousand Oaks down to 18%. That's why this red flag warning is a big concern. So it's not just an issue with the Santa Ana's. The Santa Ana's helped to allow these fires to grow rapidly in a short amount of time. But then you're dealing with the Santa Ana's and low relative humidity, which leads to extreme fire danger. And that's what we're seeing right now. And as I mentioned, it's not just for the Palisades. Look at some of these wind gusts. Ontario 45mph. Santa Clarita in at 52mph. Van Nuys, we've got a gust up to 46. And if you look and focus your eye in between Van Nuys, Santa Clarita, and look at the coloring there, when you see the whites, that's an indication of winds at 70mph or higher. Let's bring it back to the Palisades. And what's next for this community? Later on this evening, we'll start to see a drop in those winds. 6:00 pm tonight to 8:00 tonight. The winds lower in the 30 mile per hour range. But like we've been saying for the start of this event, later on tonight, we're saying in between 9:00 and 10:00 tonight, the winds will restrengthen once again. And then we've got another burst of wind for Mother Nature. So what's next in terms of our wind storm that we're tracking for the rest of the afternoon across the entire region, winds anywhere from 20 to 50mph blowing debris, downed trees, power outages is a big issue. Then tonight, this is when we are anticipating the peak of the wind. So even though it's a factor right now, it's going to get stronger in a lot of spots. So overall, 60 to 70mph for the coast and the valleys. And then you've got 80mph or plus for some of our mountain communities. And then Wednesday morning we've got another burst of that wind coming in with the Santa Ana Wind event that we're tracking. This is the third particularly dangerous situation that we've tracked this season in terms of strong Santa Ana's. The first one was in November, the last one is in December, and we're tracking this event today. You guys. All right. Meteorologist Melissa Magee there in the first Alert Weather center we want to bring in now. Chief Sam DiGiovanna and Chief Sam, we just got an update on acreage from LAFD. When we first got on the phone with you, we were saying about 20. You said 20 plus 200. Now we're up to 300 acres. Yeah. And I won't be surprised at that. Even goes higher just based on when they do their flyover to map this out. But this thing is moving fast. The winds are kicking up still and moving this fire very quickly, so I won't be surprised if that exceeds rapidly. Chief Sam, we heard from a reporter and our photojournalist on Lockman Lane. There was a gas leak. In fact, we could hear the hissing of the gas out there. Are firefighters equipped to handle that sort of thing when they roll into a neighborhood? Yes, they are Colleen there, you know, but a lot of times you don't want to just if there's a gas fire, you don't want to put the gas fire out. You just want to let that gas go. Because if you try to put the fire out, if the gas fed fire, let it burn. If it's not, you just try to find the gas shut off and just make sure that that is shut off. And I am concerned. I was a little worried about Karma there that quick. If you can hear it like that, I would say leave the area. That would be. That's my first advice that that concerns me. But yes, they are equipped to handle that and you should be able to smell gas, right? Doesn't the gas company mix something with that? Even if you don't hear it, you might be able to smell something that's not quite right. They sure do. You can smell the gas. Now I know the winds are blowing and it may dissipate very quickly, but if you can hear it, there's a gas leak. Keep your distance from it. Yeah, chief. Sam, we obviously, you know, crews are moving out of the area by the advice of LAFD. But again, this was something obviously that would be called in to the local gas company. They would be in, I guess the, the agency to turn this gas off. Firefighters can again continue to let it burn. But it's the gas agency that would have to come in and actually handle this issue. Exactly. And that's exactly what we do when we have a gas leak, either in a structure or outside from a broken gas line, we always contact the gas company and have them respond. We do have the capability to shut it off at the meter or at the street, but sometimes it's broken and we just let it run its course until evacuate the area, set up a perimeter and let the gas company do their job. Chief Sam, as we approach later in the evening nightfall, we heard from meteorologist Melissa Magee that the winds will no doubt pick up what would be the strategy as we move forward now? Well, it's very similar to what LA fires. Pio said that the game doesn't change much. It just gets more difficult. Colleen just because it's nightfall, there's power outages. And just imagine if nighttime and you have no street lights, no lights whatsoever. It's challenging. Just enough to drive your streets, much less when you have winds of this magnitude and a fire of this size. Moving through a neighborhood very, very difficult, you know, you know, they talked about LAFD, talked about how many personnel are actually on this fire, 45 fire companies just from the city of LA alone, relying on neighboring areas and their fire apparatus, as well as their firefighters. They're getting, you know, fire those fire assets from Cal Fire seems pretty significant in terms of resources, in your opinion, based on what you're seeing here, it does. I actually even saw it looked like I saw an engine from Newport Beach there. So they have resources, I'm sure, from San Diego and as far up as Santa Barbara. So bringing in a lot of resources try to put this fire out as quickly as possible, which is going to be difficult with these winds. And as I mentioned earlier, we're very fortunate right now. This is the only significant injury. I'm very surprised, and I don't want to jinx myself by saying this, that there's not another one of this magnitude. Talk to us about evacuations here. People have been advised to evacuate the area. Some were advised early on to shelter in place. How important is it? I mean, when you look at the smoke here, describe to us what it's like to be on scene and try to get out through this. Yeah, it's very difficult. The winds, the power is out, the debris, the smoke. It is difficult. And Colleen, you know, probably more than anyone. That's a big pet peeve with my with me is people not taking the warning serious. They stay and they wait too long. It puts them in danger. It puts firefighters in danger, and it contributes to the spread of the fire. And we have seen, you know, throughout the course of our coverage here from different vantage points, folks actually heeding that warning and getting out. We talked to a son who was helping his mother leave a house on, I believe it was Lackland Lane. We saw another gentleman here helping his mother in law. So again, folks are heeding the warning. That's exactly what you want to hear. But on the flip side of that, Chief Sam, we just saw a guy on Alex Rozier live shot standing on top of his roof, and we were wondering what's what's going through his mind right now? Yeah, and I see that often, Michael. And they're up there in shorts. And like I said earlier, the most seasoned veteran professional firefighters with years on the job can still get injured and do get injured wearing personal protective equipment, much less a homeowner in their pants and a t shirt just looking around or with a garden hose. That garden hose is no match for it. Pre-treating your roof is about as good as stepping out of the shower. Like I mentioned earlier, and putting a hair dryer on your hair for five minutes, it's going to get bone dry very quickly. Evacuate. And one thing I also saw is you saw cars driving around, and I saw several running right over the fire hose. You know, that's just so irresponsible. You have firefighters fighting fire, running over a fire hose. The hose can burst. And that firefighter or those firefighters fighting the fire now have no water. You're endangering their lives. So, Chief Sam, what do you do if you roll up on someone and there is a hose across the street there, you get out, try to lift it over the car. I mean, if it's the only way out, what should you do? Well, if you do have to drive over the hose, you know, at least if you can let them know. I need to get over this hose. Drive very slowly over it. If you have to. In an emergency, drive slowly. But avoided it of all possible. All right, chief Sam, we want to just put you on pause here for just a second. And we've split screen here. This for you? That shot there on the right is actually from a camera positioned in Playa del Rey. From what I understand. And Colleen, you mentioned when you first came on, doesn't matter where you are in the city, you can see this, you can see it. I was driving in here about 1:00 this afternoon on the 134 at the high point, and I could look towards that direction over Griffith Park Observatory, and you could see a plume of smoke, mixed black smoke and white smoke on top, just like this. Even when I got down sort of in the flats of the 134, continuing on, you could see this fire almost anywhere. And Michael, as we're seeing pretty much the same problem they had with the Franklin Fire in Malibu, the smoke is the issue. The smoke is laying down out there. It's hard for choppers to get in. It's hard for the aerial assault. It's hard for people to see where they're going. Yeah, well, this firefight obviously continues an update on the acreage here from 200 to 300 acres. We just got that from LAFD about ten or so minutes ago. They have 45 fire companies from LA city fire alone, which equates to about 200 city firefighters on this. We have fixed air fixed wing aircraft from Cal Fire. So again, putting as many resources as possible on this fire in the Palisades, and it bears repeating, you know, PCH, which is a main thoroughfare out there, is shut down. It's closed between Temescal Canyon and Las Flores Canyon Boulevard. Also Topanga Canyon, that route that goes really from Malibu into the valley, and the 101 that is closed except for evacuation orders there. The westbound 110 at the McClure tunnel is also closed to prevent some of the traffic jams out there that we saw early on. Yeah. We also heard from an officer with the CHP who says possibly a possible closure there on the ten freeway at the fourth Street exit. So again, this is something that may or may not come down later on, but we of course will. We'll keep you updated on on what is happening. Again, a split screen of what's happening here in the Palisades right now, a 300 acre plus fire burning as our coverage began just after 11:00 here this morning, two of the neighborhoods that seem to be affected the most from what we're seeing is Lockman Lane. We saw at least two homes destroyed there. One was gone. That's where we saw that major gas leak this afternoon. That was in the 1300 block. Also, Glen Haven and Lockman. That's where Alex Rozier was standing by showing people, some of them trying to get out of the area. And some of them, as you pointed out, trying to stay and save their homes. Right. You know, and we also had Karma Dickerson who actually, to some degree parked their car, drove or actually walked up, I believe it was Lockman Lane. She mentioned that she saw about three other homes that have been either damaged or destroyed. As she made her way up to her live shot there at the 1300 block of Lockman. We're getting a new update now, Winston, can you give me that one more time? What's the number? Wow, 772 acres. This coming now from Cal Fire. That has more than doubled since we talked about it. What, 20, 25 minutes ago? Right. We have with us on the phone right now. Lacey. Nori. She's a friend of one of our reporters here, Brittany Hope, who was in the area. Brittany, are you sorry? Nori, are you with us? Lacey. Hi. How are you? Yes, I think I ran the gamut on names there, didn't I? All right, that's okay. It's all right. I respond to anything. Okay, good, good, good. Well, thanks for joining us. Talk to us about your experience out there today. Around 40. See out my window. What Mek of smoke LA native pretty to what fire smoke looks like. So my husband said, hey, there's a brush fire near us. I think it was on New Year's Day. There's a fire in that same spot. So I kept watching it. I walked outside, I live off of sage and continue to monitor it, and it's really 15 to 20 minutes just to grow. Started and. I texted me and said, hey, this fire is moving fast. So yeah, that was my experience. This thing, you know, Lacey, we're having a slight problem with your your your cell service there. Understandably so. Again, you live on you said Glen Haven. No, we live off of Palisades Drive. Can you hear me? Better now? Much better. Much better. Yes. Thank you. Palisades Village. Okay. Palisades drive. So you you. According to Brittany, we had her on earlier. You were the friend who heeded that warning. Even before there was any type of evacuation order or any discussion of an evacuation order. Yes. That's right. At around 1040, I saw the black plumes of smoke start to erupt, like really small, very small compared to what it is now. And I'm an LA native, so I'm pretty accustomed, accustomed to what a fire looks like. So I texted my husband and I texted Brittany immediately. And what did you do? You've evacuated the area? Yes. I mean, so once I saw that smoke, I kind of took, you know, I was on standby a little bit, but I saw it grow pretty rapidly between 15 to 20 minutes. I packed up the car. I grabbed my necessary documents and any kind of valuables of that nature just to make sure I was ready to go in the event of an evacuation. And then I think it was around maybe 11 or 12. That's when it really started to get serious, and we heard that there was multiple fires in the area, and I grabbed everything as fast as possible, hopped in the car and then waited on Palisades Drive. I did attempt to go down Palisades Drive, but it was like a tornado of fire all around me. So the firefighters were there telling us to turn around. I sped back up the mountain and honestly just waited it out until I felt like, you know, we were good to go and then got the green light to come down the mountain. You know, Lacey, not to make light of this, but you are a firefighter's dream in terms of, you know, being prepared, having what you needed and getting out even before orders. Yeah, exactly. Taking ownership of what you need to do again. So when you made it down and you were told to go back out, what were you thinking at that point? I felt like I was in a video game, to be honest with you. I, I it didn't feel like real life that it was fire whipping all around me. I couldn't believe it. You know, I had to evacuate when there was the Woolsey Fire and several other fires in the past. I've never, ever been this scared or this close to a fire like this before. Lacey, does it seem to be moving away from your area now? It seems like it's going towards the ocean and not going up towards the valley. It seems like it's going towards the ocean now. When I did actually get down, there were cars parked on the sidewalks like it was an apocalypse and just sporadic little fires everywhere. I'm just so glad to have gotten out, even though it's not coming towards me. Lacey, you mentioned the Woolsey Fire. You had to evacuate then. This, I assume, is your second time. Will you continue to live in the area? I'm sorry, what was that question again? I said, you've evacuated before you mentioned this, and it sounds hellish what you went through? Yes. Trying to get out. Will you continue to live in that area? Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's the thing is, like, that's the beauty of where we live. I love the location. I love being close to the water. It's kind of a trade off, to be honest with you. We know and we've known ever since we moved into this house. That fire is a concern. But if it's not fire, then if we live somewhere else, it could be tornadoes. So it's kind of just the trade off with where we live, in my opinion. You know, over the course of time, Lacey, since you first made contact with our colleague and your friend Brittany, this fire has grown from 20 to 200, 300 and now 772 acres. Based on the fact that you're you're there witnessing this all, are you at all surprised by how fast this fire has moved and how fast it has grown? Oh, 100%? I mean, I feel like it was within seconds where I thought it was just isolated in one location, and then seconds later, I'm being told it's in another location. I think that's the scariest part. At a certain point I thought, okay, maybe it might be safer at my house, but just again, seeing how fast the fire moves and it moves from one tree to the next tree like it's magic. You know, I just was like, you know what? Like, this is not make sense. Everything in my house is replaceable. I just need to get out of here. So yes, definitely very scary with how fast it moves and how unpredictable it is. Lacey, talk to us a little bit about community there. You mentioned you're in a home up there are neighbors looking out for neighbors. Did people stay behind? What did you see when you came back to the neighborhood? Yes, I was hanging out in my neighbor's driveway, actually talking to him about, like, his thoughts and what he was experiencing because he was a Palisades native, specifically. And then, you know, it was a lot of camaraderie with my neighbors saying like, hey, it's blocked off again. Don't go down there like it was at least like 6 or 7 of us discussing, like what our next steps were. And really, you know, we have a close knit community. So I will say, like, we're all here for each other. And all the neighbors were like working together on like, what we were going to do next. Yeah. The fact that you, you know, you took your own personal advice, you listened to your gut and your husband and you got out of there. Yeah, yeah. And your property and your family and everyone within the area are all safe at this point. Yeah, we're all safe. I've got my two dogs in the back seat, my German Shepherd and my husky. They're pretty upset they're not at home, but I think they'll thank me later. And yeah, my husband and is also safe. He's driving towards me now, so I feel good about my decision. And everything is replaceable. Not myself or my dogs or my husband. So, Lacey, anything you would do differently moving forward in terms of moving forward? Yeah, protection of the house, neighborhood, anything like tha. Definitely. Moving forward, I would say. I mean, it's just advice for anyone. Always have copies of your documents ready in one singular location and like know where everything is. You know, and I don't think I really would do anything different. Maybe leave like ten minutes earlier. Honestly, I feel like just ten minutes would have made me not get stuck up there for so long. But I would say just from like a document perspective and all your valuables, like keeping those in one place is definitely key. All right. Lacey Norris, thank you so much for your time. And this experience and taking us through what you have been through here since early this morning. Appreciate your time. Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you. Glad to hear that you're safe. You know, it is one thing to hear from firefighters about what you should do, but sometimes when you hear it firsthand from someone like Lacey about what she did and how she did the right thing, you know, it resonates a little bit more. I think she's going to be the new LAFD spokesperson. There you go. In terms of what to write about that because she just nailed it from start to finish. All right. So we want to bring in now meteorologist Melissa Magee obviously keeping a very close eye on what is happening and what's to come Melissa. Yeah that's right Michael and Collee. It's a dangerous situation in the sense that we're dealing with the Santa Ana winds. So something sparks the fire and then we've got weather conditions in this case the Santa Ana winds that help the fire get bigger, faster and more dangerous. And it's dangerous because those Santa Ana's as we look at the satellite loop, this is a two hour loop. It really gives you a clear picture of what's going on. If you look and take your eye just to the west of LA, you can see we've got this area. It looks like clouds, but this is actually our satellite imagery. Picking up the smoke in the atmosphere. And it's all because of those Santa Ana winds. So we've got those winds coming in really strong so fast out of the northeast, dropping through the mountains, the canyons and passes, and in this case through the Basin all the way down to the coast there in the Palisades. And that's why we're dealing with those strong winds. And we just spoke to the young lady who said, now it looks like the smoke is moving toward the coast. And that's exactly right in terms of Santa Ana wind formation. And it's not just in the Palisades. We've got strong winds everywhere. Van Nuys gusts up to 46mph, Santa Clarita gusting up to 55mph. Haven't really touched on Orange County in the IE, but still very strong there, as well. Santa Ana winds gusting up to 40mph. Riverside 41, Ontario 45mph. Bringing it back to the Palisades. You can see not only do we have the winds, but strong relative humidity that's lowering two guys. All right Melissa, thank you for that. Our Camilla Rambaldi is live at Glen Haven Drive and Lockman Lane. That's an area where we saw a lot of smoke. And it's still going on out there. Camilla. Colleen. Melissa, talking about those strong winds, those gusts. It has only increased here at this hour. You can just tell from our live shot just how intense the wind is. And you can see the plumes of smoke here behind us taking over this hillside left. You can also see some of those active flames up here on the hillside. And you can just see in our live shot and just hear just how powerful these winds are. And that has just been the biggest concern for this area. Moving this wind in every direction, a low visibility and also just the air quality has only decreased here in the last few hours. So very difficult to breathe right now. But you can just see just the amount of smoke that is accumulating here from this fire. We're here off of Glen Haven Drive and last. Drive earlier we saw several people using hoses to just put water on their homes, taking any steps they can to protect their property. Earlier in the afternoon, I also saw several people trying to evacuate. But as we've been reporting this afternoon, Sunset Boulevard here it on at a gridlock. So it's so hard to get out with people stuck in traffic back to back. Colleen. Yeah, well, Camilla I'll pick it up from here. Camilla. So we have had a couple of other reporters here near or around the same location. You are right now. Are there folks still in the neighborhood, cars coming in and out. What are you what are you seeing? I am still seeing some cars come through. Not as much as earlier, you know, obviously people have started, have left, have started to leave. But there's still some people coming through. Earlier we were on, I believe it was Carmel Avenue, and you could still see some homeowners in the area trying to figure out what to do their next steps as they saw this, this massive plume of smoke just behind their home. So obviously having to take that immediate action and that and that concern with these powerful winds that are that continue to pick up. Well, talk to us a little bit about the winds. Are they picking up out there right now? Describe what it was like when you arrived on scene to where it is right now. When I first got here, just about around noon, the winds weren't as strong. And just in the last I'd say 20 minutes that we've been here in this area, specifically on Lockman Lane an. Up. All right. So I heard her correctly. It's like they are picking up right now. She said. Within the last 20 minutes or so, those winds out there in the Palisades, Pacific Palisades have actually picked up. Melissa, we want to bring you in now to, you know, sort of a piggyback on what Camilla is saying at this point. Yeah. And I'm sure it's so hard just with reception because of the winds in that area. It's a big concern and we're starting to see the winds pick up at this moment. Earlier we were talking about gusts in the Palisades and the teens. Now we're at 24mph. Topanga beach, 35mph. Santa Monica mountains. And at 60mph. And these winds continue to get stronger in that area. They're coming through the mountains, through the canyons, and passes all the way down to the beach and the Palisades community here. Also starting to see the relative humidity drop as well. When we first came on the air and told you about the Palisades fire, relative humidity was anywhere from 35 to about 45%. And because of those strong Santa Ana's are coming in from the northeast, quickly racing through those canyons and passes that air compresses. It warms at the surface and it dries out the surface, and that's drying out the atmosphere as well. I want to show you what's going on with the fire speed, because when we first went on the air in terms of acreage, this was about 200 acres. And you can see it's more than 700 acres at this hour. So as fires move uphill, they spread and they move rapidly every 10 degrees of slope, the fire will double in speed. So essentially you've got the rising heat from the flames preheating the fuel out ahead of it, up the slope, causing it to ignite even faster. So let's talk about the Santa Ana Wind event. What's next? What does this mean for everyone in Southern California? Because this is a dangerous situation in the sense that the winds are so severe for a prolonged period of time. Looking at the pictures there on the left, you could see that Santa Ana wind is just blowing that smoke in erratic directions right now. And then look at this. We've got what looks like a Porsche there and a structure, perhaps a vehicle fire. Excuse me, a structure fire as well, with some hotspots in the area. So those Santa Ana winds are blowing these embers long distances in terms of the strength of the winds and what we are anticipating, winds anywhere from 60 to 80mph, we could find gusts in the mountains 80mph or higher, some isolated spots even stronger than that widespread impact. Multiple regions affected, including these wind sheltered spots and the duration it's today, right through Thursday, peaking later on tonight into Wednesday. You can see just looking at those live pictures, Colleen and Michael, what that Santa Ana wind is doing to conditions out there in terms of that vegetation, there will likely be lots of hotspots. It's not just containment with the actual fire, but then you've got some hotspots in between all of that fuel as well. Jerome, we're talking about these winds. They're really blowing those embers up forward. And that's what's keeping the fire moving. We're going to go back right now to Alex Rozier. Alex, are you still at Glenhaven and Lockman in that area or. You look like you've moved a little bit. Yeah. So we are we're at Glenhaven and Lockman, but the challenge that I've expressed throughout the day and that families out here and that we're dealing with is that the connectivity, the cell phone service is very weak out here. So this is one intersection where we do have service. Let's walk you out here though. This door is going to swing open. There's a roof that appears to be on fire there in the distance. As we look directly to the east, we again are at Glenhaven and Lockman. You can see the flames that are coming from that roof right there. We've been watching this for the last five minutes. After we arrived back at this intersection, and this story continues to change by the minute because the winds change by the minute. And depending on where you are, it could be a quarter mile away. It's a very different situation than where we are. So speaking of that, as I mentioned, the cell phone connectivity is weak. I'm trying to get a piece of video back to our newsroom, but the service is I want to show you what we saw at Enchanted Way and Scenic Place, and I'm going to show you it on my cell phone, because that's my only option right now. But there's a home here that is completely in flames. Again, this at Enchanted Way and Scenic Place and the home that is next door to this property is also on fire right now. This home, about a quarter mile from where we are standing. And the thing about this is that, you know, the home across the street hasn't even been touched at all. And to see if this video continues here, but you can see the flames are raging at this place, at this home specifically. But yes. So that is about a quarter mile from where we are again at Glenhaven and Lockman. You can see this property in the distance that roof is on fire. So there's just a lot happening in a, in a very dangerous situation that continues right now. Colleen. We'll send it back to you. You know, Alex, we heard from the LAFD that at least 30 vehicles were just left abandoned at sunset and Palisades. They're going to have to be moved by the county with a dozer. Did you see any of that as you were trying to make your way into the neighborhoods? Yeah, I think that there's a number of people who have made a decision here to just leave with potentially someone else. But as Susana. Let's turn you around and walk you back out to the street, and we'll show you what we can see from the street here. Because there are there are people who have made the decision to leave some of their vehicles. And the other part, you know, we've talked about it throughout the day. But the thing that complicates this is this happened in the middle of the workday when a lot of people already were at work, and it happened in the middle of the school day when there were a lot of kids at school. But you can see this road specifically looks a bit empty right now, but it's family by family. The decisions that they made, whether they left their vehicles or what they grabbed. But it's very quiet here now as as people likely are watching anxiously and nervously to find out what how this is going to play out, guys. All right Alex Rozier live for us there. We want to now turn our attention to a NBC 4's Karma Dickerson. She is live near a home that is actually burning right now a strategic firefight going on right now here Karma. Firefighters doing everything they can to save every home that they can. And just minutes ago flames erupted at this one on Lockman Lane. Now, there had previously been a fire in the back of the home, but a big gust of wind came and the flames shot up. And you can see they're doing everything they can to beat it back there. Firefighters on all sides of this thing. We watched as they rushed in as the new black smoke erupted from this home. They're working on it, but they recognize, you know, that this is a really challenging situation. So much so we want to give you an idea of what they tried to do to once they realized that the flames were going to overtake this house, we walked up as they were in the midst of pulling these items from the home. Now you can see right here, this is a large clock here, a large what looks like an antique, very beautiful family clock here on the ground. There also photo albums that the firefighters pulled from the home just minutes before the flames overtook it because they said if they felt like they at least wanted to save something, as they realized that these flames were overtaking the home, we can't really tell what exactly led to the flames flaring up as they did. Besides the heavy winds that came through. But you can see even through the windows, the glow of the orange showing that the fire is moving from the back of the property closer and closer and closer to the front of it. And so that work continues right now. Now, the interesting thing is, we passed this home maybe five minutes before, and we didn't see anything like this. So it shows how quickly things can change here. It really seemed that there was nothing in particular happening at this home. We went past it up the street and then we turned around and we saw that heavy black smoke. And actually just in front of us, we've had a big leaf from a palm tree fall from those heavy winds. So we're going to try to readjust and stay clear of this tree if we can maybe move a little bit further this way. So we're not right underneath that tree. So as the fire is one hazard, there's still the heavy wind creating other hazards here on the ground. A reminder that if you are still home, if you are still in the area, or if you're in any area where there's heavy winds, there. Obviously we we're having issues. Everybody is out there because we're on cell service out there and everybody is on their cell phones out there today trying to communicate with people. But we're talking about the smoke and how far away you can see it. I saw it from the 134. We showed you pictures from Playa del Rey. This is a picture of downtown LA. I believe that's what we see in the background here. Barely see it in the background there, that is for sure. Here on the right is a camera here from Playa del Rey positioned there. So two very starkly different views here of the fire depending on where you are in the city. What's interesting about Karma's situation with that house on fire is we've been in that neighborhood several times. Nothing else around that house is on fire. There were two other homes just down the way that caught fire and were destroyed, but everything else seemed to be okay. You would almost get a false sense of security that things were moving out of the area, and the wind was taking the fire, someone else somewhere else. We talked about this with Chief Sam earlier today, and even though it might not be happening in your particular neighborhood, there is no safe zone in a fire zone, essentially. So again, he talked about how those embers could be carried by these gusts of wind, wind, gusts of, you know, three to 4 or 5 miles away. So again, no one is safe. No one is immune to what is happening here. A lot of people evacuated in the area. Joining us on the phone right now is Mimi Teller. She's the communications manager for the Red Cross LA region. Mimi, are you with us? Yes I am, how are you? We're good. How are you? Talk to us a little bit about what the Red Cross is doing with this fire. So we are currently opening up or transitioning, I should say the current evacuation center in Westwood at 1350 Sepulveda Boulevard. It's been an evacuation center for the last few hours, but now we are transitioning it to a shelter and it's going to provide a safe place along with snacks and water for anyone who's affected. When you say transitioning out to a shelter, is this for overnight accommodations as well? That's correct. Yes, and there's hot showers too. All right. So folks have been evacuated. Either they've been evacuated because they had to or because they wanted to. Have you seen a stream of people come to this location? I'm not at the location yet. And we just pulled the trigger maybe 20 minutes ago. So it will take us at least an hour and a half to get it ready to accept folks. So we'll have somebody on the ground there in about an hour. So I'll have more information at that point. But Mimi, what about pets and small animals and things of that nature? Will they be allowed at the shelter as well? So right now, since this is still very, very early days, we haven't heard what the status is. If we are able to accept the small domestic pets, we do ask that they are in a carrying case or a crate or, you know, they're their their little tagalong carriers. But we will have more information on that all shortly. I mean, this is all just been happening in the last 30 minutes as far as the request coming into us already. Yes. I'm sorry. Standby. But now the details are coming in. Yeah. Standby. And again, you're already within 20 to 30 minutes of establishing the shelter, talking about transitioning now into an overnight shelter for these folks. You guys stand at the ready. You don't need to get ready. You stay ready. That's correct. And we've actually been ready since Saturday night for this. We already had our shelter trailers positioned in the area. As soon as we heard this fire started this morning, and we've all been on standby, ready to do exactly what we're doing now, provide safety for those affected. Mimi, I don't know how long you've been with the Red Cross, but historically, are you seeing many more situations where the Red Cross is being called to assist than you ever have? Yes. And not just more situations, but bigger, costlier, more damaging situations. So we all know we just had the Malibu fire less than a month ago. So yeah, this is two big fires in less than a month already in our area. Okay. If you can talk about the shelter here for a second in terms of what people can expect when they get there, how many folks can you accommodate? What can we tell our viewers? So again, it's early days. I don't know the shelter population, but we usually anticipate at least being able to house 50 to 100 people initially. We have a full staff there. They're going to make sure everyone's comfortable. There's cots, there's blankets. We will provide three meals a day. And most importantly, information, information, if they need to connect with loved ones and also information on the status of their homes. Maybe when people show up at these shelters, what do they tell you when they see you? A lot of people are in shock, and some people are so numb, they they just I barely got out. I barely got my pet. And unfortunately, sometimes they're not able to get their pets. So we do urge people if they think they might have to evacuate, get their pets in one room and close the doors so they know where they are. But usually we see people in shock and we just want to, you know, give them comfort and let them know that we are there and we will support them through this experience. Of course, you guys are likely a lifeline for them in terms of providing information that they need, perhaps want. And again, in addition to the accommodations, the meals, the full staff, the whole night before we let you go, Mimi, anything you would like our viewers to know about the work that the Red Cross has provided, what you do and how they can benefit from it? Well, what we do is, is available to anybody who needs help. So anyone who is affected, it doesn't matter your status at all. Please, we are there to help you. Please come and you will be safe. You'll be comforted and be prepared and download our emergency app and you'll get alerts and more information on what to do in situations like this. All right. Mimi Teller with the Red Cross. Thanks so much for your time and all the work that you do. Thank you. You're welcome. I believe on the right side of the screen, what we're seeing right now is the shot from Karma Dickerson. Or is that the left side? She's on the left side where firefighters are tackling that fire at the house. Karma, are you with us? Hold on a second. Karma you back with us now? I'm sorry. Well, we can tell you her location. Maybe we can establish contact with her. This is right at Glen Haven and Lockman. It's a place where we've seen at least two other houses. This may be a third one. Karma is back with us now. Or not? All right. Well, interestingly enough, what what stuck out to me about Kamau's last live hit, and that was the fact that she said they had passed that house about five minutes before, and then realized it's now up in flames. So you talk about the nature of this fire, how things can change so quickly. And that's proof of it right there. You know, you also talk about the job that the firefighters do out there. She said. They went into this house. They removed a grandfather clock. They've removed photos so that the family, when they come back there will have something. They carried it across the street, put it on the sidewalk there. You don't think of that in terms of the jobs that they do. But but they do. They do so much more than just put out the fire a little extra. I mean, and we talk about not only are we dealing with the, the, the winds and the, the firefight at that point, but we saw with Karma, there are other elements involved as well. Palm fronds falling down, you know, and again, gas leaks, gas leaks that we've reported on as well. So a lot of challenges, a lot of unexpected situations out there for firefighters and for those who live in and around that area. Melissa Magee we're going to call you back in. Are we are we approaching the witching hour, so to speak, for when the winds pick up out there in a few hours? Colleen later on tonight? I mean, we're still expecting the most intense winds to arrive later on this evening. So the time frame we've been giving is any between eight, nine, 10:00 tonight, right through the mid morning hours tomorrow. I want to show you the satellite imagery because this really tells the story in the sense that we're dealing with strong Santa Ana's. And if you look at the wording of Los Angeles LA and then look off to the West, you've got this large smoke plume. So we're able to detect this fire large up, well up in the atmosphere. And that fire, or at least the smoke from the fire is blowing from the northeast all the way down to the south and west. These are significant. Santa Ana's on the way. And this is the strongest Santa Ana wind event we've seen so far this season. We've got an update for you for folks living in that area, if you see the smoke and the ash in your neighborhood, we've got a wildfire smoke advisory. This has just been issued, so this will stay up until 5 p.m. On Wednesday. Santa Monica you are included in that in areas to the south and west for Calabasas over into Malibu. So some wildfire safety tips for you if you see the smoke or the ash. Remain indoors. Close the windows. Obviously, if you're in an evacuation situation, it's a bit of a different story for you. Do what you can to get out and get out swiftly and safely. Avoid any physical activity outside, and if you are outdoors, keep it brief and use a mask. Let's bring it back to the Palisades Fire and what we're tracking in terms of the wind, the relative humidity and those strong Santa Ana's, the Palisades. We've got winds gusting up to 24mph, Topanga Beach or close to 30mph. Then look off to the north and west and the Santa Monica mountains. We've got winds gusting up to 54mph, with sustained winds a little lower than that. But it's the gusts. That's the concern as we go throughout the rest of tonight. Also, something of note and something that I've noticed since we've been on the air talking about this fire, is that the relative humidity is starting to lower signicantly. Earlier today, we had relative humidity numbers anywhere from about 35 to 45%. Now we're in the low 20s. This will continue to lower later on tonight and into our Wednesday as well. Let's bring it back to what happens next for the Palisades in this community. We've got winds later on tonight that will start to peak. Right around that time. We were talking about around 10:00 up to 44mph. There will be a bit of a lull. I don't want people to think that they have issues with this wind event being over, but this will likely pick up once again as we get into our Wednesday morning. Let's talk about the wildfire triangle and what's fueling this fire here. We've got Santa Ana winds. We've got a topography driven fire, a wind fueled fire, all of the vegetation, the brush, the trees, the palm trees, and the weather helps to spread this fire fairly quickly. Relative humidity will continue to lower as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon into tonight, which is why that red flag warning has been issued right until 6 p.m. On Thursday. Strong Santa Ana winds, low relative humidity. We're seeing it right now. Rapid fire growth up to 700 acres. All right Melissa, thank you for that. It is now 3:00. We're continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Good afternoon everyone I'm Colleen Williams. And I'm Michael Brownlee. Thank you so much for being with us. We have been on the air bringing you this live coverage since 11 a.m. A race to escape a dangerous wildfire. I'm seeing a lot of the same chaos along Palisades Drive as people are trying to get away from this fire. People in Pacific Palisades forced to evacuate at a moment's notice. Homes have been destroyed behind us on Enchanted Way. There's probably four homes that were lost. Whipping winds fanning the flames as firefighters work to try and get a handle on this wildfire. The NBC 4 news at three starts with breaking news. Hundreds of homes are now in the evacuation zone. This fire is currently burning more than 700 acres in the Pacific Palisades area, prompting closures and evacuations. An evacuation shelter has been established at Westwood Recreation Center. It's at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. We want to show you a map of exactly where this fire is burning. The evacuation orders have been established for the fire area all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway PCH. Now, throughout our coverage, we have seen several homes burning, including this one here on Pacific Palisades. There on Glen drive, NBC 4's Karma Dickerson is in the thick of things. There is a fire. Last time we checked with her fire burning a house directly behind her. Let's check in with her once again. Karma. Firefighters are still doing work on this home on Lockman Lane. You can see it behind me. Those orange flames pouring from the windows, pouring from the roof. And this is something that really just developed in over the course of about 15 minutes. At one point there was no fire. Then all of a sudden there was fire overtaking this home. I spoke with one of the firefighters working on this and he said they're not trying to save the home. They recognize that the home is gone, but they are trying to minimize any potential damages to other neighboring properties. Make sure that Ember Cast doesn't send the fire to the south of it, to the north of it, particularly with what neighbors are dealing with with these heavy winds that are out here. While they could not save the home, one thing I do want to note is they were able to save some of the family's keepsakes. I'm not sure if we have the video ready to show you, but as we came up, we first noticed this heavy black smoke. The first thing that caught our attention as we look down to the ground was firefighters running out of the house carrying photo albums, carrying a grandfather clock, carrying items that look like they were perhaps antiques or keepsakes. And I asked them what that was about, and they said, you know, at least it's something. At least they'll have something. Recognizing that the way the flames were moving, the way the wind was coming, that that was certainly going to overtake this house, but they could leave the family with at least just a little bit of home. I asked about these firefighters. This is station 37 out of Westwood. This is Los Angeles Fire Department. And so they're just one of the agencies on the ground doing their part to try to save this neighborhood, save this community. Again, the concern is that with the heavy winds, those flames could easily be pushed further down this neighborhood. We have seen as we go up and down the street, we want to be clear along Lockman. Certainly more that has been saved than that has been lost at this point. But as the winds shift, that can easily change, and the firefighters recognize that making a stand, property by property, doing everything they can to try to minimize the spread of the fire here now, in terms of conditions along this road is also pretty key because it connects to the fire. This neighborhood. Wondering if they can get out of the road. While it is open, because they do need to firefighters in and out of that road. You're going to encounter fire hoses. You're going to encounter heavy smoke. You're going to encounter homes on fire. It really isn't safe to be trying to get up and down this street. You know, making sure you're listening to the best emergency responders in terms of what you're supposed to be doing, whether it's being in your house or evacuations. But Lockman and the fire road that people are so familiar with, it's not a safe place to get in and out of at this point. So we're going to continue to watch as they make that stand here with this house, to try to stop those flames from going any further. But again, they're up against it with. It's hard to breathe. The ash is in the air. The embers are falling. So definitely making sure that if you are still in your home, you're inside and you're being safe. That's the latest from the Palisades. I'll send it back to you. All right. Karma Dickerson live there for us. And again, the valiant effort made by those firefighters to get those belongings out of that house. Joining us right now, once again, he's been with us all day. Chief. Sam. Chief. Sam, you see what we're seeing here with this smoke plume? You hear? The acreage has more than doubled in just a few minutes. It's, I believe, 772 acres at this point. What goes through your mind in terms of resources for this? Well, the first thing that goes through my mind, Colleen, is that we're fortunate there's not another fire of this magnitude burning. There's sufficient resources, but I've seen resources from as far south as Orange County on this fire. So they did call in for a lot of resources. That's what's going to help with this. But, you know, we're not out of the woods by far for the next few days. And it's only supposed to get worse. That's what concerns me. You know, Chief Sam, we spoke with LAFD earlier today during our coverage, 45 fire companies, which is about 200 city firefighters. That's just from the city of Los Angeles with fixed wing aircraft. There assets there from Cal Fire. We are expecting wind gusts of about 40 to 45mph between 9 and 10:00 here tonight. We talked about earlier today the window slowly closing on this fixed air. Fixed fixed wing aircraft that can be used during these gusts. Are these types of gusts? Yeah. When the wind starts getting above 40, 50 miles an hour, you're going to see aircraft grounded, not to mention the fixed wing that will be grounded at night. If the winds subside a little bit, we could use the helicopters with having the night vision goggles capability so that they're able to work the fire at night. But again, that's going to depend upon the wind. Chief Sam, if you lived in the area and you heard evacuations, but not necessarily for your area, what would you do as a homeowner? You yourself, would you take precautions and evacuate any way? Self-evacuate you know, if I live close to this knowing and the winds blowing the way they are and the forecast for a long, prolonged. Yes, Colleen I would I would find a friend or evacuation or evacuation center, get my important documents, medication, eyeglasses, laptop, pick up and leave. You can replace your home and valuables, but you can't replace your life. Yeah, we spoke to a homeowner who felt exactly the same way you did Lacey, who said, look, these valuables, these possessions can be replaced. But you know, my life, my dogs lives, my husband lives. My life cannot be replaced. So again, heeding the warning. Yeah. Lacey, my new poster child for evacuation. She did a great job on that. And I wish everybody would follow. And she even said, I wish I would have left ten minutes earlier. And you know, that can make the difference between life and death at times. Chief Sam, we' e heard about people just getting out of their cars and going, there's a report from the LAFD that at least 30 cars are just sitting empty at Palisades and Sunset. How much more difficult does that make a firefighter's job when they run into something like that? Colleen that makes it extremely difficult, especially that street I saw that had two lanes on it. There's a lot of roads in LA and surrounding all throughout Southern California that are a lot more narrow than that. That was a wide lane. Both sides. And they still it was gridlocked and they had to evacuate and leave their cars because they weren't getting anywhere. So again, it goes back to that. Even like Lacey said, that ten minutes earlier, maybe even go 20 minutes earlier or even right now, we know the winds are going to pick up. If you think that you're in the path of this fire, why don't you go find a friend's home or a family member's home, stay out of the area and that does not pertain just to the Palisades fire. I'm saying that to everyone. Think right now, prepare ahead of time. We know that this fire has grown exponentially here. LAFD telling us at 1.300 acres. Cal Fire now bumping that up to 770 acres based on the conditions here, chief Sam, we shouldn't all be surprised by what we're seeing here in terms of acreage. Not at all. Michael and I would even I'd expect this to grow a lot more, especially as the night comes and the winds are going to pick up. This is going to grow a lot more. And unfortunately, we're going to see more homes destroyed or damaged. You know, Chief Sam, we Karma Dickerson showed us firefighters carrying out a grandfather clock, photos, things out of a house. We think of firefighters in terms of, you know, stopping the fire protection in a neighborhood. That's a whole nother side. I don't know that people think about that. I like that you brought this up. Colleen. We take this very serious. You know, we want to protect people's homes. We want to protect their lives. And we do go through and firefighters go through the to biggest detail and beyond what they should be doing just to protect and to take the homeowners belongings out of their home. That may be the only thing that they have left standing or having in their home. Once the home is burned. All right, chief Sam Digiovanna, if you can hold tight, that'd be great. We want to now bring in NBC 4's Alex Rozier, who is located live there for us on Glenhaven and Lockman Lane, which has seen a lot of activity here since this morning. Alex. Yeah. Michael. And it's tough to hear just the reality that the most intense winds have not hit yet because there are just the images that we've been seeing over the last few hours have been so troubling, but we've had the chance to speak to people like this man's family, who his mother in law lived here. He was telling us, Stewart, and she's been here for the last 30 years. Never have the flames come this close to her home. I want to turn you around. We've been watching this hillside in the distance and in the distance. You can see that home that continues to burn about a quarter to a half mile from where we are right now. And that, sadly, is just one of the homes that is burning right now in the Palisades. I want to show you some video that we shot within the hour. This video we shot at Enchanted Way and Scenic Place, and we just drove down the block and there are a couple of homes that are completely in flames. And as this fire has been throughout the afternoon, you've got right across the street. Those homes have not been touched by fire, but unfortunately a few have been taken over by the flames. And that's what we were seeing right there. Again, that's about a half mile or about a couple of blocks a quarter mile from where we are right now at Enchanted Way and Scenic Place. Let's bring you back out. Live here. I'm hearing some emergency vehicles. This has been we see an ambulance, LA city fire ambulance. That's the first ambulance that I've seen rush up the hill during this ongoing emergency. But for the most part, it's been pretty quiet. We've seen a number of emergency responders who have been out in the neighborhood between the LAPD, LA County Fire, LAFD, but that was the first ambulance that we've seen occasionally, like this vehicle right here. We'll see potentially a homeowner or a neighbor who lives in the neighborhood taking off. But most for the most part, it's quiet and people are watching with anticipation here. But right now, the biggest story is this home that's in the distance. And we're going to continue to monitor this because it changes by the minute and the winds. It's they're so unpredictable. And the direction of the wind is unpredictable too. So we're just hoping for the best in this story. That is ongoing and dangerous right now. All right Alex Rozier live for us there at Glenhaven and Lockman. Now we are awaiting a press conference here by fire officials here set for 330. We of course will bring that to you live here on NBC 4. As we've heard from our reporters in the area there in the Palisades, the wind appears to be picking up. Our meteorologist, Melissa Magee is here with more on that. And, Melissa, you say it's not even the worst of it yet. Not at all. Colleen and Michael. In fact, we're tracking the peak of those winds. They will likely move in later on tonight and into our Wednesday morning. You know, David's on deck. We've got Stephanie. Everyone's working together to give you the very latest information we were talking about. As we're looking at the live pictures of the structure. Fire this home fire. This is a perfect example when we talk about spot fires, when we're dealing with Santa Ana winds, you've got not only containment with the actual fire that's burning, but then you've got the Santa Ana winds that are bringing those winds and flying embers into different locations of unburned fuel. So this is a big concern as we track the conditions with the Palisades fire. I want to give you the very latest in terms of the observation data and what we're seeing very close to the Palisades fire here. We've got winds gusting up to 70mph in the Palisades, Santa Monica mountains, winds gusting up to 58mph. And since we've been on the air, I've seen the relative humidity lower significantly. From this morning into the afternoon. Hours earlier today, we had relative humidity numbers anywhere from 45 to about 55%, and now they're lowering into the lower teens there in Topanga Beach. So you've got all of those strong northeasterly winds moving down through the mountains, the canyons and the passes from the northeast all the way down to the south and west. And it's really drying out the atmosphere. I want to show you the satellite imagery. This is a two hour loop here. And if you take your eye just to the west of Los Angeles, this is an indication of our satellite imagery picking up that smoke well up in the upper levels of the atmosphere here. So again, it's coming in from the north and east, all the way down to the south and west, blowing out into the Pacific Ocean. Let's talk about wildfire triangles and what that typically means. We need certain things to help fuel fires. We've got the Santa Ana winds that are helping to make this fire more dangerous and more intense. So we've got the topography. That's the brush, the trees, the hills in the area there in the Palisades. And the fuel is also the dry conditions there on the ground. The weather we have outside right now, a drop in the humidity and the strong, significant northeasterly Santa Ana winds. The most significant Santa Ana wind event we've seen so far this season. Also new this afternoon we've got a wildfire smoke advisory, so this will stay up until 5 p.m. On Wednesday. Until tomorrow. This is for Santa Monica. You are included in that because of the Palisades fire back to the north and west through Calabasas and just to the north of Malibu. We're dealing with strong smoky conditions and the winds are everywhere this afternoon. It's not just confined to the Palisades. Look at some of these gusts. Santa Clarita, we've got gusts up to 55mph, close to 50 in Lancaster, 40 in Riverside. And then we look at gusts there in Los Angeles, 15 down to Long Beach and at 30mph. So we're even starting to see these winds be an issue for some of our typical wind prone and wind sheltered locations. Let's talk about what we can expect. What's next as we go throughout the rest of tonight and into our Wednesday here. For the rest of this afternoon, we've got winds gusting anywhere from 20 to 50mph blowing dust, debris, downed trees, power outages is a big concern in some communities. And then tonight, the peak of those winds will arrive anytime between 8 to 10:00 tonight through the overnight hours. And as we wake up tomorrow morning, in terms of what you can anticipate with those winds, winds for the coast and the valleys gusting anywhere from 60 to 70mph in some spots, and then the mountains will likely have winds gusting anywhere from 65 to 80mph, some spots higher than that for some isolated communities. Wednesday morning we've got another burst of wind from Mother Nature that will be on the way. This is going to be slow going for the commute, and of course, we're tracking the conditions as a result of the Santa Ana. As you're seeing it here on your screen here, the trees, the palm trees in that location, just blowing the smoke, the ash. And we're seeing just dangerous spot fires in that area. You guys all right Melissa thank you. We want to remind you that we're waiting for a press conference from LA fire officials about the extent of this fire and what's happened. We're going to go. And there you see, they're setting up for it right now. We expect that in the next, I don't know, ten, 12, 15 minutes or so. We're going to go back right now to Alex Rozier. He's on Glen Haven and Lockman. Sadly we were watching a house just in the distance burned there Alex. Firefighters haven't been able to get a handle on this. Yeah it's tough to tell from where we are Colleen. But you know we we've been out in the general vicinity for about the last couple of hours. And it's just it's really just shocking how fast things can change here in this neighborhood. I mean, we've for the longest time had been seeing this home, and the flames had been close. And then all of a sudden they just took over this property right here. But I think that speaks to the importance of listening to these evacuation orders. And because with the winds gusting like they are shifting directions, this can change so fast. And that's what we're seeing right here. But it's really difficult to consider the realities of what we're faced with right here. And all these families, so many of them that have lived in the Palisades for such a long amount of time. And now these winds continue and they strengthen throughout the night. We'll be interested to see how the LA City Fire Department, what they have to say about the ongoing story out here. But I can tell you that we have been seeing crews pop up here and there, but frankly, with how fast the winds are moving, it's tough for them to do their jumping from spot to spot. They've got as coordinated of an approach as they possibly can. But right now the winds are so fast moving and so unpredictable, and it's led to what we're seeing right now. We have a fire in the distance directly to the east. And as I showed you in that video that we showed previously, a couple blocks behind us directly in the West, there are a couple more homes. And that's just what I've been able to see with my own eyes. So we'll we'll be watching this as it as the night progresses and, and as these winds sadly get more intense. Colleen and Michael, you know, Alex, before we let you go here, you spoke to a homeowner who was helping his mother in law. Evacuate not too long ago, and he says he's lived in different parts of the Palisades, but he has never seen this part of the Palisades burn before. No. And he actually has made the decision now to evacuate. So Stewart, who we talked with earlier, has left. And I think everybody's just hoping for the best and hoping that the winds don't get any closer to these homes. As I mentioned, this home right here, we're standing with his his blessing on the on the property of his mother in law's house. She's been here for 30 years. And so many of the people here have stories similar to this one that she talked about all the work that she's done here, and they're just keeping their fingers crossed. You know, when we were first pulling up today, aside from the homes, you have the schools that are nearby. We were driving up off Pacific Coast Highway into the neighborhoods here. We were passing schools and the kids that were evacuating. And I mean, the no time is ever a good time for this, but it was in the middle of a workday, in the middle of a school day. And it's causing big problems. As we get closer to the to the rush hour into the early evenings here, you know, as we look at this, Alex, Michael, Melissa, this looks to be different than the Franklin Fire. Yes, we have the winds, but this appears to be so much more a densely populated area. When we looked at the fire, the Franklin Fire in Malibu, we could see brush on fire. As we look at this one, we're seeing mostly homes and structures on fire. Am I seeing that correctly? Yeah, definitely. And that's I think that's, you know, just from our vantage point and watching this home burn. I mean, if you look directly below it, there are a couple more roofs and a couple more homes and so many families packed into the Palisades here. And that's similar to what we were seeing earlier when we were making the drive on Enchanted Way. And Scenic Place. You know, there were homes back to back to back and we, you know, covering this fire today have to be watching very closely too, because as I mentioned, the winds snap, you know, change with the snap of a finger and, and you know, given what we're looking at, the homes packed in, it could be bad. So we at this point we're just really hoping for the best. All right. Alex Rozier live there for us in the thick of it here. And we have just gotten some new numbers now from Cal Fire. Colleen. Yes. Keep in mind this fire broke out, what, 1030 this morning? Yeah, the new number in terms of acreage burned is 1200 acres plus. So when we say this fire exploded, that is no exaggeration. Not at all. Not at all. As we await now, a press conference here from L.A. City fire officials on where this fire stands now and again, looking ahead, what we're in store for again, let's get to a homeowner that we spoke with earlier. We're told he evacuated even before that order came in. I evacuated from the Pacific Palisades. We noticed fire starting up on the ridge, probably around 10 or 1030. It started moving very, very fast. We were watching the updates from LAFD and following the steps of ready, set, go. So by the time they said that it was a mandatory evacuation, myself, my family, all our neighbors, we were all already packed and in our cars and getting out of there and it did come down. The smoke was getting thick very quickly. By the time it was time for us to go, my spouse and most of the neighbors, they were there for the Evy fire and. So it's part of the experience of living in Los Angeles. You don't mess around with fire. Fire moves so fast. And we're watching all the engines coming in from all over the county and beyond, and we don't want to be underfoot while they're trying to do their work. The one takeaway I have from that, and I bet you heard the same thing I did. You don't mess around with fire at all. I know anybody who's covered fires out there, Chief Sam, they would certainly agree. All right. We are going to bring in NBC 4's Karma Dickerson again, keeping a very close eye on a very strategic firefight out there. And some valiant work here made by some firefighters. Karma. Valiant work, indeed, because they recognize that this house has burned, but they understand the importance of making sure that it doesn't. Thereby. So they continue a pretty strong effort to contain that fire, to contain some of the heat. They say they want to walk you down the street. He's on the road down here. If you look in the distance, we can see on the other side of the street another fire. Now, we haven't been able to get very close just yet. All right. So obviously having yeah, having cell connectivity problems there with a Karma. We will check back in with them in just a second. The winds continue to be an issue okay. Let's go to NBC 4's Camilla Rambaldi. Again we've established signals with her. Camilla. What are you seeing? Obviously some active flames behind you. Yeah. Michael and Colleen, we came across this home burning here on Donner Way and probably about 20 minutes ago, the homeowner of the home right next door came to check on her house frantically, you know, trying to get Ahold of, you know, fire crews right now. You can just see how close those those flames are getting to this white home right here on my own. Photographer Tommy Bravo jumped in to help her with the hose. But those flames were just way too intense. And it's only intensified just in the last 5 or 6 minutes. You can just see those flames taking over the roof of this home. And the intensity of that black smoke billowing into the air. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see, you know, scenes like this in Pacific Palisades and that homeowner who evacuated the area here, she told me she just grabbed some, you know, her personal belongings, her documents, and drove and drove away. But you can just get the sense, just the emotion, just how heartbroken she was to just see how close her home is to this other home that is burning right now. Camilla can you give us the street you're on again? Did we hear you? Not away, I forgive me, I may be saying it incorrectly. It's believe. It's not a way. Okay. D o n a I r e way. Are you still on? Can you guys still hear me? Yeah, we still got you here. And just the intensity of these flames and the plumes of smoke that are coming out of this, and you can hear the alarm of some alarm going off in the, in the distance, the alarm. Exactly. You can hear that alarm in the background like you just described, Michael. Just the intensity of these flames and just how quickly they have taken over this home from the roof. And now to the windows here, right toward the front of the home. As you guys can see. And there is so much brush as well surrounding this home, which is obviously very concerning with that, with the intensity of these winds and those embers flying with these potential spot fires. And these flames spreading to other homes, are there any firefighters, any first responders in the area at the moment? No. So we have not seen any crews out here right now. So the woman, the homeowner that I spoke with, who's next door, she was very, very concerned, hoping that fire crews will get here shortly. So we've just been watching this home burn here in the last 30 minutes or so. Wow. So that neighbor is still in the neighborhood. What about the rest of the neighborhood? What does that look like? Overall, it's very quiet. We haven't seen anybody else out here. We did see at least one, 1 or 2 cars drive up here. It's unclear if you know they live on the street. They came to check on their home, but again, just the heartbreak of this homeowner who came by and just started to see how close and intense those flames are and how quickly they how close they're getting to her home right now. And you can just see from our live shot just the intensity of that smoke billowing into the air. Wow. And you can now just see those flames, you know, picking up right here at the front of the windows, here of this home. And again, that brush those trees surrounding this property and just how close it is to other homes as well on this street. Camilla any idea what started this is the is the brush in the backyard burning up close to the house? Was it an ember? I mean, could you tell from our vantage point it's very difficult to see. When we initially drove up, the flames were centered towards the back of the home. Here there's some toward the entrance of the home, I should say. There's a little bit of a hallway. That's when we saw those those those flames initially. And then those flames just erupted. Just picked up, you know, engulfing the rest of the home here. But it's very difficult from our vantage point to see, especially with the amount of, of smoke that there is, where exactly this fire started. If it started in the back of the home and worked its way forward. So it's still it's still it's very difficult to tell right now. Obviously, witnessing the tragedy of this home burning, but obviously the heightened level of concern for those neighbors on either side of that house. I mean, will their house be next? I mean, and Camilla did you mention the house to the right of that? That neighbor is there or does it look like everybody I may have lost you guys. Can you guys still hear me? Yes, we can hear you. I'm not sure if she can hear us. Okay. Go ahead, I can. I can hear you guys now. It's just, again, just so devastating to see this. This is one of several homes that we have seen here in Pacific Palisades burning at this hour. As we spoke to that homeowner, just hoping, you know, someone fire crews will get here to spare her home. But obviously just very difficult to watch this right now. And it's only intensified. I'm trying to see Michael, the house to the right. Looks like there may be someone in that house. Is that what you're talking about? Camilla. She's so on the right or the house right here. There is no one. There's no one inside. That homeowner evacuated that we spoke with, but we can't tell. Up the hill. There's another home. Just trying to get a better idea of how close it is to this home that's burning right now. But it's very difficult to tell. Right. So the good news here in all of this is that the homeowner to the right of where this fire is burning has evacuated, evacuated. So again, we were wondering whether, in fact they were still on the property. But they have since evacuated again just living with the unknown at this point. Yeah. And at least at this point it is contained to that house waiting that that homeowner you said living with the unknown is the best way to describe this. All right. Camilla Rambaldi, we appreciate it. Now we can tell that I'm just walking up the hill here. You can just you can get a better idea. It's hard from our vantage point, but just how close those flames are now, getting to this neighboring hom. Right. That is so sad. When you look at it, it is intensified there again. You look at the flames just billowing through the windows. There again, the homeowner, Camilla, spoke with lives to the right of the structure that is currently burning now, and. Again. You can only hope with no ground crews inside, at least from our vantage point. Again, living with the unknown. As we mentioned is this a scary situation there for that homeowner? And as Chief Sam pointed out, the smoke is black. So clearly there is fuel inside the home or behind the home that is burning right now. This one, I hate to say it on Donato Way looks like a total loss. All right, we will check back in with the Camilla here as our coverage continues. It is just after 330. We're continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Thank you so much for being with us. We have been live on the air, bringing you coverage since 11 a.m. This fire is currently burning more than 1200 acres in the Pacific Palisades area. It's prompting closures, evacuation and evacuation shelter, we can tell you, has been established at Westwood Recreation Center. They're going to transition that into a shelter, meaning people will be able to stay overnight. It's located at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. Several homes have been destroyed, although it's unclear at this time just how many. Want to give you a live look right now at Will Rogers State Beach Park in Pacific Palisades. That's where California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to speak, along with fire officials here. We, of course, will bring that to you. Live when it happens, and we want to remind people if you are headed to the area, the best word is don't. PCH, according to Caltrans, is closed between Temescal Canyon and Las Flores. Topanga Canyon Boulevard is closed except for evacuations in that area, and the I-10 at the McClure tunnel is also closed to prevent any more traffic tie ups out there. We're going to get back out to Karma Dickerson, who's standing in a neighborhood where we're watching another home go up in flames, Karma. Yes, we're coming to you from the neighborhood where we are looking at multiple fires. The home behind me, you can see is they're still working to make sure the flames do not make it any further. They're fighting it from multiple different angles there behind the home, there on the side of the home. The idea is to try to make sure that this does not spread any further. But if you look just down the street, over on the right side, we see the home that's covered in flames. And as you go up and down this main thoroughfare, Lockman, we see evidence of firefighters just trying to do everything they can to make sure that the situation doesn't get any worse. If we take a look, can we show on the top of the home there, there's a firefighter on top of a neighboring home? Are we able to see him there on the roof, keeping an eye on things, trying to understand the fire movement, the fire behavior and giving directions down to the crews on the ground to let them know what he's seeing from that vantage point. Because it's interesting, because when you talk to the firefighters at each different home and you ask them about the bigger picture, many of them don't really have context for that. They're focusing on what they're seeing right in front of their eyes. And so to help them understand what the overall conditions are and what the bigger picture of the street is, you need someone with a bird's eye view, someone who can help put all the pieces together so they really understand what they're dealing with. We're on the same street where earlier today there was a gas leak. We're actually not far from that home. We did give that a good amount of distance, but that is another danger that firefighters are potentially encountering. And people who are still in their homes. We haven't seen any neighbors out on the street, but I have seen a person or two peeking their head outside of their homes. And really, based on the conditions out here, it's safer to stay inside. There are embers that are flying. Obviously the heavy smoke, there's wind and even branches that are coming down off trees. We were just steps away from getting hit by a branch not too long ago. So a reminder that if you are still sheltering in place to do just that, keep the doors closed, the windows closed, and definitely keep your your news on so you know what's next and you know what's coming. But the winds continue to fuel this fire down the street. At times they'll push the smoke clear out, and then you see a little bit of the sunshine. And then at times you'll get a wall of just black, and you can't tell if it's night or day. So that's how things are changing here a little bit further up on Lockman. And so we're going to continue, of course to, to follow firefighters as they do everything they can. Worth noting the house that we're taking a look at right now. They've been working on this for at least 45 minutes, doing everything they can to beat back those flames, actively fighting the fire, but still just not making any progress in terms of, you know, keeping the flames back, though, the winds are not making it easy for them. They send ships in and they send ships in to do what they can to make sure that it doesn't expand. But the flames continue to come. And so just an idea of how difficult it is once something becomes fully engulfed Karma under these conditions to get those flames down. And as you see Karma black smoke and the wind, we're going to interrupt Karma for just a moment. They're about to start this press conference. Let's listen in to go into all the specifics, we have a list of eight individuals that will speak for you today. After those eight individuals will have Spanish, and then we'll have follow up questions. After that, we'll have one on one interviews and let you know when the next press conference will be. So we ask at this time, please silence your cell phones, turn down your radios, keep your sidebar conversations off to the side. But to begin with, we'd like to call up the fire chief of the Los Angeles City Fire Department. Christian Crowley. Well, good afternoon, everyone. I'll be giving you a brief on what your LAFD has done up to this point. So at 1030 this morning, a brush fire was reported at 1190 North Piedra Miranda Drive. And our local fire station here right behind us. The fire station, 23, Los Angeles, is currently experiencing an extreme fire weather condition with red flag alert. At the time of the fire, the relative humidity was 12 and the winds were approximately 25 miles an hour with gusts up to 50mph. Based on the red flag weather, your LAFD. Pre-deployed additional resources made public awareness notifications and issued parking restrictions in high hazard fire areas to ensure that the means of access and egress of our local fire stations and apparatus could move up and in around the area. First, LAFD resources reported. Initially, a ten acre fire with 40 mile per hour winds and alignment heading towards the west or towards the ocean. The LAFD then requested all resources, including strike teams and aircraft, from assisting agencies. We then went into an aggressive attack and focused our efforts on fire life safety operations, beginning with evacuations. Currently, the fire is at 1261 acres and growing based on aerial reconnaissance. The fire is being fueled by a combination of strong winds and surrounding topography, which is making it extremely challenging for our personnel that are assigned to this incident. We currently have over 250 LAFD firefighters on scene, including 46 engines, three trucks, five helicopters, four brush patrols, two water tenders, six paramedic ambulances, one fast response vehicle, one advanced nurse practitioner unit, two bulldozers, ten chief officers fire investigators and safety officers. Additionally, we are so grateful for the hundreds of law enforcement officers, partner agencies, first responders and public work members that are engaged actively in this operation. PCH is closed from Lincoln Tunnel to Topanga Boulevard. Evacuation orders are in place for approximately 30,000 residents, including the Highlands area north of PCH, south of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, east of Tuna Canyon Road, west of Seabreeze Drive, and Surfside Drive. Our evacuation center is the Westwood Recreation Center, located at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard in LA. The population threatened is approximately 25,748 households, threatened. It's approximately 10,367 structures. Threatened are approximately 13,208. At this point, we feel very blessed at this point that there's no injuries that are reported. We do have reports of multiple structures that are damaged. Since the beginning of this fire, I've been in constant communication with Mayor Bass as well as other city leadership who's working very, very closely. As you can see, this entire entity behind me, we're working seamlessly and closely to ensure that we are protecting lives and property first. So with that, we'll go ahead and introduce the next speaker. Thank you, Chief Crowley. The next speaker will be the Los Angeles County Fire Chief. Moroni. So good afternoon. My name is Anthony Moroni. I'm the county of Los Angeles Fire Department chief. Shortly after the start of the Palisades Fire, LA County fire did assist the city of Los Angeles with a first alarm brush assignment at 11 30 hours this morning, our LA County Fire Department went into unified command with the City of Los Angeles, and at 1230, our Cal Fire partners from the state went into unified command with not only LA City Fire, LA County Fire, and LAPD. Currently, LA County Fire is providing aerial resources to fight this brush fire, including our Fire Hawk helicopters, our CH 47 part of our nighttime QRF resource that we have in addition to our CL 415 super Scoopers, we also have three engine strike teams assigned and almost 100 L.A. County fire personnel. I want to let all of the viewers and listeners know that we are not out of danger. The National Weather Service has predicted that the winds are going to pick up and get worse. We're going to have the most significant wind event between 10 p.m. This evening and 5 a.m. Tomorrow morning. So it's incumbent that everybody have a wildfire action plan for their home. If they live in a brush covered area, please visit the LA County Fire Department website for ready, set, go information. So that's fire.la County.gov forward slash RSG and for the most up to date incident information and emergency preparedness information, go to LA County Forward slash emergency. Thank you. Thank you. Chief. During emergencies always by our side is our friends from law enforcement. So we'd like to invite LAPD Chief of Police Jim McDonald. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are here in a support role to our fire partners. Just a quick rundown. We have over 100 officers here deployed another approximately 60 ready to be deployed once a mission is given to them. So far, the major job for our people have been evacuation, traffic control, allowing ingress and egress to emergency vehicles. And those can be helpful. I would have an ask that if you would please do everything you can to open up the streets so we can get the resources we need to be able to deal with this emergency. Please take this wind emergency very seriously. As you heard from the speakers before me, this is something that is going to get worse throughout the night. So we all have to look out for each other. Areas of evacuation so far, about 30,000 people have been evacuated from a total of 10,000 households, or 15,000 structures, to include businesses and other buildings so far with no injuries. So we're very thankful for that. But we truly ask for all assistance that we can get in making this as smooth as we possibly can. Thank you. Thank you, chief McDonald. We'd also like to call up L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, please. Thank you. My deepest thanks to the first responders who are working tirelessly to fight this Palisades Fire. Moments ago, Chair Barger signed L.A. County's emergency proclamation for this fire for the severe wind event and all of the fires related to it. As the National Weather Service predicted, this is a life threatening situation to our Palisades and Topanga community. Under evacuation order, please leave. Ensure your home is unlocked. The power is off, and making sure first responders can easily access the structure. This is essential to keeping you safe and to allowing fire and first responder personnel to do their work. For our unincorporated communities in Santa Monica mountains, including Sunset Mesa, Topanga Canyon, and Malibu, all under evacuation order and evacuation warning. Please ensure you are checking emergency LA county.gov and heeding all door to door information from our L.A. County Sheriff and fire departments. Thanks to our partners at the Topanga Coalition for Emergency Preparedness who work year round to practice evacuation drills and emergency preparedness. And they're working tirelessly right now to ensure information is shared across Topanga. For those with livestock, the evacuation location is Pierce College. For those needing small animal, small animal evacuation location. The animal Agoura Animal Shelter is available to you. Thank you to Governor Newsom for your quick support and coordination. Thanks to Mayor Bass, to Council Member Park, and all of the council members in the city and all of our partners city, county and state, unified and working together to keep people safe and address this fire. The county and city of Los Angeles have a lot of experience in unified command. This emergency is no different. We're dedicating every resource we can to urgently, urgently contain this fire. I want to extend my gratitude to the Los Angeles County Fire Department, the Sheriff's Department, the Office of Emergency Management, and all of our county partners. I know LAUSD officials also wanted to be with us, but given the conditions, that was challenging a few school updates, Topanga Elementary at Woodland Hills Academy will be relocated all week. Palisades and Marquez Elementary will be relocated at Brentwood Science Magnet for tomorrow. Paul Revere Middle School will be relocated at University High tomorrow. Pauley High School is not in session this entire week, and Canyon Elementary will be relocated at a location to be determined to those affected by the Palisades Fire. I know today is terrifying and it is painful. Please know that you are not alone. The County of Los Angeles and all of our partners are here together to stand with you and be in support of you. Thank you again to everyone who is contributing resources to this incident. Your partnership is appreciated and it is essential to keeping people safe. Thank you very much. Thank you. Supervisor. Next, we'd like to bring up Los Angeles City Council president Marqueece Harris-Dawson. Thank you so much. I just want everybody to know that since this morning, about 7 a.m, I've been in direct communication with Mayor Bass, who's on her way home from a diplomatic mission on behalf of the United States government. She will be here within hours. Also, we want everybody to know that the city is well prepared and has a tremendous emergency management infrastructure. Who has been on the case since 6:00 this morning at the beginning of this wind event. I'm proud to say that we have some of the best men and women anywhere in our fire department and our police department, as well as their partners across the state and across the county. I am also want everybody to know that as Acting mayor and president of the L.A. City Council, along with the county, and we'll hear from the governor later. The city of LA is declaring a state of emergency through this wind event, and we'll have all resources on deck. And our ask, our personal ask, and we'll hear from the councilmember from this district. But if you can stay off of our roads, please do so to allow emergency vehicles to go across the city and also remember, we'll continue to drive this home. The worst and most severe part of this wind event is yet to come. So if you're around the city and you have been spared, be thankful, but also be on guard. Bring your lawn furniture in and again, help us by staying off the roads and I will ask the council member from this district, who's been on the street since early this morning, making sure the neighborhoods have the information that they need and resources that they need to come to the podium. Our own Councilwoman, Traci Park. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for being here. And Council President Harris-dawson, I want to begin by thanking all of our public safety partners, LA City Fire has over 250 firefighters on the front lines in the hillsides right now actively fighting this fire, supported by more than 100 firefighters from L.A. County fire, as well as additional resources from Orange County, Ventura County, Cal Fire and neighboring cities including Arcadia and Santa Monica. I also want to thank our partners in law enforcement for their terrific, coordinated response with us today, LAPD, LA County Sheriff's Department, CHP is here, as well as our park rangers. Obviously, the scope and scale of today's fire here in the Palisades has been terrifying. We are so incredibly grateful for the swift response. And to my constituents here in the Pacific Palisades, I want to reiterate this is not a drill. This is an actual public safety emergency. Areas west of Mandeville Canyon and north of sunset have been ordered for evacuation. So please make sure that you are packed and ready to go and complying with all directives being given to you by law enforcement and our partners at the fire service as well. LA city is activating emergency shelter at Westwood Recreation Center. People in the Palisades who have been displaced by today's events are invited to go there. We are working with Animal Services to receive and care for pets that are being displaced as well, and as additional resources come online. We'll be providing those updates for you. Local residents should follow along for additional information and updates through official city channels, as well as LAPD, LAFD, and LA County updates. As this is a dynamic situation, this is a fast moving and growing fire at over 1200 acres at this point, and with the predicted wind patterns and continued weather event, we expect the. Situation to continue through the evening. It may take our partners at fire a couple of days to get the situation under control. It may be some time until people are allowed to return to their homes and residences. Please bear with us through this period as our public safety partners work hard to protect lives and property and ensure that this area is safe before people return. In the meantime, if anyone needs additional assistance, I would welcome them to reach out to me and my team. All of our contact information is at cd11 dot L.A. City.gov. Thank you to my friends and constituents and thank you to all of our partners, including Governor Newsom, for being here with us today. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you ma'am. We'd like to now ask Council Member John Lee to please speak. First of all, I just want to thank all the firefighters who are on the first responders that are fighting this fire right now. Also, a big thank you to all the organizations throughout the city, county and state that are assisting our firefighters and what they need to do today. As chair of the Public Safety Committee, it's my job to monitor situations all throughout the city of Los Angeles. And the most important information that I can share with you today is to all of our residents. As soon as we get any new information, we are trying to disseminate that as quickly as possible. It's important that you listen to that information. As someone who represents a district that is commonly affected by fires, one of the issues that is, we ask our residents to do is if you're asked to evacuate, if you're asked to stay outdoors, whatever it is that we're asking you, if you're in one of those affected areas, that you don't create additional problems for our firefighters. So our firefighters can focus on what they're supposed to do. And that's getting this fire out. Thank you all for being here. Thank. You. Thank you, Council member. And now we'd like to ask the governor, Gavin Newsom, to please speak. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Hell of a way to start a new year again. Let me add my voice, the voice of so many others and extending deep appreciation to the men and women in uniform across jurisdictions. I want to thank in particular, Chief Crowley and Chief Mahoney for your outstanding leadership. Police chief, Sheriff's Office, all of our local law enforcement agencies that work hand in glove. There is simply no better mutual aid system anywhere in the United States of America. And you're seeing it now at scale once again here in Southern California. I say once again, because we were here not too long ago, the Franklin Fire a few weeks prior to that, the mountain fire, November, December, now January, there's no fire season. It's fire year. It's year round. And it's incredibly important that we heed the warnings, the calls that we're not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. You may feel at home that you're fine down in Riverside County, San Bernardino County, down in Ventura County, other parts of the state. But there's a reason we pre-positioned hundreds of assets and personnel on Sunday in anticipation of this wind event. 110 engines specifically were sent down 45 by Cal Fire, 65 through our mutual aid system, through the Office of Emergency Services. Water tenders down here, seven new helicopters we brought from Northern California down to Southern California. We just brought our C-130 down from Northern California and already just had its first drop by no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods. You heard the chief say 10 p.m. Tonight to 5 a.m. Tomorrow will be peak winds. And having just quite literally an hour or so ago, gone up the canyon and saw firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers and the number of structures that are destroyed. Not a few. Many structures already destroyed. And the fact that people were still not evacuated, still did not heed the warning. We're just coming down the canyon is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is. You listen to these evacuation orders. We've all been to memorials. I've never been to a memorial for a building, but for family members and loved ones. I know you cannot say this enough. It's foundational. One other thing I want to say, because you can't say it enough, is expression of gratitude. The president of United States happens to be in town. It didn't take more than a text message to get the F mag approved, which means we're getting reimbursed for the vast majority of these costs. No politics, no hand-wringing, no kissing of the feet. President of United States said yes. What else do you need? Emergency proclamations being drafted as we speak. And I just want to thank the president, because that's something I don't take for granted and something we should not take for granted at this moment in American history. So thank you, President Biden, as well. Final point, we encourage you. You heard all those websites. I don't want to burden you with any more except one. Fire Ca.gov. And why do I say that? Nothing like it in the country. Nothing like that. We've seen in any jurisdiction around the world. 3D maps and live cams on fire. Ca.gov would also show you the evacuation orders. I encourage people to take a look at that site for information. And of course. Redcross.org to make sure that you're prepared. As we work through yet another extraordinary month in this fire year, perpetual fire year here in the state of California. Thank you again to all of the folks behind me and the outstanding leadership of all the elected officials as well. And forgive me one point I'd be remiss. Thank you to Mayor Bass, who was on the phone immediately this morning, making sure, even in absentia, that she's here organizing everything she can to make sure we're successful as well. Thank you, governor, appreciate that. We'd like to open this up now for Spanish, and then we'll go to questions. So we'd like to have public information officer for LAFD, David Ortiz. Buenas tardes. A las dias y medio de esta tarde comenzo un incendio en la comunidad de Pacific Palisades en el municipio de Los Angeles. Este incendio rapidamente se papago a mas de. Cientos acres Han habido la orden de evacuation para 30 mil personas en esta area y pedimos al publico. We've been listening to the very latest on the Palisades Fire. It is 4:00 and we are continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Good afternoon everyone. I'm Colleen Williams and I'm Michael Brownlee. Thank you so much for being with us. We have been on the air bringing you live coverage since 11 a.m. It was fire whipping all around me. I couldn't believe it. You know, I had to evacuate when there was the Woolsey Fire and several other fires in the past. I've never, ever been this scared or this close. People in Pacific Palisades forced to leave their homes as flames from a wildfire close in traffic congestion, making it difficult for some to get out. So this has got to be people's worst nightmare as they are out here. Basically stuck in their cars, not able to move that they will be caught in something like this. Firefighters are racing to try and stop the flames from spreading. NBC 4 news at four starts with breaking news. Well, that fire is currently burning more than 1200 acres in the Pacific Palisades area, prompting closures and evacuations. More than 30,000 people have been forced to evacuate. We also want to let you know an evacuation shelter has been established at Westwood Recreation Center that's located at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. We have live team coverage as the peak winds are still to come. Melissa Magee and David Biggar are standing by. But let's start with Robert Kovacik live on Sunset Boulevard, where people abandoned their cars. Robert. So where we are right now is we're on sunset, just near Palisades Drive, and you can see the aftermath of what certainly was sheer panic as this fire just exploded this morning. So what you are looking at here are a number of cars, I would say over two dozen. And what has happened here is that a bulldozer, we understand, has had to shove them out of the way so these firefighters could get to this blaze that continues to burn. And as Scott Webber pushes up, you can see right there on the hillside, just another home completely gone from this fire. So this morning, picture these cars trying to get out of the Palisades. This is a condensed neighborhood. This is an isolated neighborhood just off sunset. These homes are close together. And then the rush to leave suddenly had to abandon their cars. When they abandoned their cars, they left them right here on sunset. And then they had no choice but to. Fire department had to take a bulldozer and just clear these cars away. Since we have driven here this afternoon and it has taken some time because of the roadblocks, the endless roadblocks that they have set up. Once you hit Palisades Village, the wind picks up and there is fire on both sides of the street and their fire continues to burn on both sides. Here we've got fire crews here, we've got a number of LAPD officers here trying to clear people out of the Highlands, which is right there at that intersection. The majority of the smoke and the flames that you see right now coming from the hillsides. But continue continues to burn on both sides of the street. This is what you see right here. This is Sunset Boulevard. Everybody here on the west side of Los Angeles. Rarely do we see fire coming down the hills like this, but this is completely charred here. The homes that you see up on the ridge have been managed to be saved. And you see firefighters, you see that one firefighter there in the smoke that you can barely be able to see them. They are still doing structure protection up on those hillsides. But again, structures lost as we have been covering throughout the day. And you see a major property up there, Scott, behind us that we have just watched continue to burn. So the Highlands here continues to be where the area right now that they seem to be focused on in one part of the Palisades. If you are trying to get out and if you are looking for ways to get out, just keep in mind that sunset heading east is basically it is. It is just a gridlock of cars trying to still push out from this neighborhood, as they still try to leave. But these are the people, Michael and Colleen, that couldn't leave today, that were panicked enough to abandon their cars and have to leave them here on Sunset Boulevard. It is a remarkable sight. I will tell you, in all of my years, I've never seen anything quite like this, and we've really never seen a fire that has started to chew up this area that is so close to Sunset Boulevard, so close to Palisades Village, and the fire is just licking this area right here, and it keeps trying to come down the hillside. As we drove in today, we saw it heading up into Will Rogers State Park. There's plenty of brush to burn there, and it's actually moving into the right direction in that are, because there aren't a lot of homes here. But right now, homes continue to burn. The fire department has done what they've needed to do. They have cleared out an area of Sunset Boulevard, and these abandoned cars, many of them damaged, have been able to be cleared to make room for the firefighting effort. All right, Robert, thank you for that. That really does speak to the narrow roads and the closely confined ingress and egress areas in this fire area. We want to let you know to the picture you're seeing on the right side of the screen. I believe that is a home on fire on PCH. Getty Villa Drive. We now understand this fire has burned all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway. Acreage has grown over the past few hours, now up to 1200 acres. Again, we continue to monitor this. A good time to bring in NBC 4 meteorologist Melissa Magee to time out these winds. We talk about the peaks of these winds. Now what? Approaching just hours away. That's right Michael and Colleen. So that will be the issue. Even though we're dealing with strong winds as we speak, as we're battling the Palisades Fire, the winds are only going to strengthen and intensify later on tonight. %e heard it during that press conference around 10 p.m. During the overnight hours until 5 a.m. On Wednesday, and just looking at the images, you know, Colleen, we were on the air talking about the Franklin Fire close to Pepperdine and the difference you were talking about between that fire and this fire, there was a lot of dry brush and vegetation. There are hotspots in the path of the current fire that we're dealing with right now, creating more problems, more destruction, and unfortunately, more damage. So let's talk about the latest observation data as it relates to this fire this afternoon. We've got winds in the Palisades gusting up to 20mph. Topanga beach, 16mph. Then look at this in the Santa Monica mountains, up to 66mph. This is the strongest I've seen it this afternoon. And also, we're starting to see the relative humidity lower as well. So winds with a drop in the humidity not the best combination because that continues to dry out the atmosphere. Relative humidity down into the low teens there in Topanga Beach. And a side of this fire is that we've got wildfire smoke advisories. So this is new this afternoon. This will stay up until 5 p.m. On Wednesday because of the blowing smoke and the blowing ash in the area. So Santa Monica off to the west in Calabasas and Malibu. You are included in that. The winds aren't just for the Palisades. They are all across Southern California. That's that's why this is a very rare event for us this afternoon. Look at some of these winds gusting up to 51mph in Santa Clarita. We've got a gust there in Van Nuys, up to 43mph. Haven't touched much on Orange County and the IE, but still very strong there. Ontario close to 50mph. And we've got a gust in Lancaster up to 44mph at this hour. Storm reports new this afternoon. We're getting reports from the National Weather Service that a tree is blocking the road close to Beverly Hills. This is what we were talking about in the sense that we're also seeing those winds being very destructive in areas that are typically wind sheltered. So this is right now Beverly will drive in between Cisco and Beverly, Wood Street, Rancho Cucamonga, a semi overturned on the roads there. Running springs and areas in San Bernardino County. We have winds gusting anywhere from 74 to 77mph. So it's the Santa Anas and that red flag warning up until 6:00 pm this evening. Strong Santa Ana winds coming in from the north and east, all the way down to the south and west. It dries out the atmosphere as it warms and compresses at the surface, and we're starting to see extreme and rapid fire growth. One thing I want to share with you this is very powerful imagery that we're getting with some of the computer data that we have satellite imagery showing you the smoke plume from the fire in the Palisades, coming in from the north and east, all the way down to the south and west. Significant Santa Ana wind event that is on the way. That's the very latest. We talked about the peak intensity later on tonight. I do want to bring in my colleague, meteorologist David Biggar, to talk about what's next as we go throughout the rest of the evening. And David, we'll talk about that now with you. Yeah. And Melissa, it was amazing to see in that satellite image you had some wave clouds as well as the smoke plume. So one quick check of the winds and then we'll get into what we're looking at over the next couple of hours. Melissa was just pointing this out. 66 mile per hour gusts across some of our peaks. That is our primary concern as we get into the overnight hours tonight, we're going to develop what's called a mountain wave, where we have just the right flow in the atmosphere over the mountain tops, and you end up almost with a very similar waterfall effect. So the winds will then descend down the backside of the mountains. And any of the communities, such as Pacific Palisades and other areas right along the foothill locations, will be potentially looking at some strong wind gusts. So here's an example of when this might happen. So this is just the next couple of hours. And this is just a sampling of the wind gusts. Keep in mind we might have the occasional gusts a little bit above some of these numbers that you're seeing. But as we go into the overnight hours tonight for Pacific Palisades, you can see 6:08 p.m. Looking at gusts in about the 30 to 40 mile per hour range. But it's suddenly right as we get closer to midnight that you see the numbers jump up briefly around the Pacific Palisades area, gusting up to 45, potentially 50 miles an hour. Even stronger before it sort of drops back down, but it stays very gusty well into tomorrow. So let me show you some other regions here to kind of give you an idea of what this mountain wave looks like. So here's a look at the wind gusts. Futurecast specifically zoomed in around the San Gabriel Valley. 6 p.m. Look at some of these gusts already in the 35 to 45 mile per hour range. But as we get closer to midnight, here's where that mountain wave picks up this red coloring on our map. That's wind gusts above 60 miles an hour. You can see the Duarte, Glendora, even Pasadena, looking at wind gusts 50 to 60 miles an hour. This is the kind of wind that starts to downed trees. And so we're likely going to start to see that as we go into the overnight hours. And it stays that way through the early morning 5 a.m. You can see a lot of this purple coloring still on the map. And that's 40 mile per hour gusts or stronger as we bring it toward the west of it. Now we include parts of Ventura County. Here's the Santa Monica mountains. Topanga beach would be the closest observation site to what we're going to be showing for Pacific Palisades. You can see that by 7 p.m. We've already got some pretty strong wind gusts. Look what happens as we get closer to midnight. We start to develop that mountain wave effect we've got now gusts above 50 miles an hour throughout parts of the Santa Susana mountains. We're getting that wind gusts up above 60 miles an hour for Burbank areas near the Verdugo Mountains as well, and that will continue through the morning. So by 7 a.m, look at the gusts around Camarillo. Look at Point Mugu, gusts above 50 miles an hour. We're seeing that for Malibu as well. Still very gusty through where the fire area is. And that is our again, our primary concern through the next couple of hours is that we're looking at these very strong wind gusts tonight. So that presents the rain the possibility of what we call long range spotting, where any of the embers that get thrown up by the fire can be carried, not just a few hundred feet, but potentially miles out ahead of the fire, sparking new spot fires, and that makes it very difficult for firefighters to get on top of because again, you're popping up fires left and right, guys. And that means that now firefighters have to go over here. They have to go over there. And it quickly becomes a situation that becomes difficult to control a cat and mouse. All right. Exactly I appreciate it. Thank you. We want to turn now to NBC 4's. Tracey Leong live along PCH near Will Rogers State Beach Tracey. Yeah, yeah. Michael. And just the visibility out here is horrible. We have our goggles on right now, but I can feel my eyes watering because that smoke is just seeping through. As you mentioned, we're along PCH where you can see that fire has made its way down the hillside. This is the bluffs right here. And just a moment ago, you can see those palm trees were starting to burn and we saw the fires move up that hillside towards these homes. And it's burning just along. I mean, there's dozens of homes right here. And you can see those flames just burning out of control right along the highway. And you see these cars going by. And now driving through this, Michael, is just so difficult. My photographer, Sean Browning and I, as soon as we hit this area in the bluffs, it was so difficult to see on these roads. But as you can see, everyone is evacuating right now. They are trying to get out as quickly as possible. But take a look at the smoke. It is just covered the entire sky. We are next to Will Rogers State Beach and you can see that smoke just blanketing the ocean. It is so eerie out here right now. You can see that glow of orange coming through, but this entire area is smoky. We have seen people come out here just to watch what's going on, but it's really not recommended to be out here without a mask, without goggles. These conditions are horrible to breathe in. They're horrible to just be in right now. Sorry. It's even hard for us to talk as we watch this come down. You know, we've seen crews just passing us. The highway is closed. Pacific Coast Highway is closed in this area. But of course, if you live near here and you need to get out, that road is open for you to leave this area. But yeah, as you can see, it's really difficult. I know it's smoky right now, but that house looks like it is about to go up to see the flames. It's burning that side, that wall, the flames have already hit it and we can't see the back side. But the flames were coming up just behind it. And the ashes, they're just flowing down. It is so difficult to breathe. It is difficult to see. And as soon as this house goes up, you know, these winds are so strong. It just jumps quickly from structure to structure. Thousands of structures are threatened out here. So this is, you know, just a really big concern. But that's the very latest out in Pacific Palisades. Back to you in the studio Tracey. We're going to let you catch your breath for just a moment there. In the meantime, we're going to switch live to Darsha Philips, continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. She's at Sunset and Temescal. You can see, Michael, the wind really looks like it's picking up there. Darsha. Yeah, it is really picking up here. Colleen. It is difficult to stand it sometimes because of these gusts. They are so strong. I want to show you just down Temescal Canyon, you see a car is on fire. We see tons of these spot fires that kind of erupt because of these very strong winds that are blowing through the canyon here. That fire, that car caught fire just about 30 minutes ago. And, Colleen, I do want to tell you we were here about 45 minutes prior to that. It did not look anything like what we're seeing right now. You're seeing this thick black cloud of smoke just billowing through the intersection here of Temescal Canyon and Sunset Boulevard. Now, I was also told by a city worker that Palisades Charter High School is on fire. I don't know how how damaged it is right now, but that is where we saw lots of fire crews rushing to try and save the school down there. We're just less than a half a mile away from the high school. Now. You also do see people still evacuating because when I say how quickly this fire came through here, it was 45 minutes. We could see the sky. It was not that bad. And then all of a sudden the wind shifted and it blew through here. And it's like a blowtorch when that happens, you see this very thick smoke. We have fire at the high school that that just beyond that gate is where that high school is. And then we also saw fire jump Temescal Canyon and get on to this apartment complex. We did speak to one person who had to evacuate very quickly. He didn't think that it was going to be that bad. He stayed. And then he looked outside of his window and saw the skies this dark and decided, you know what? I'm getting out of here. Just up the street, literally half a block away from where we are right now. There is a senior living assisted living center that had to be evacuated. We were there as the care workers were rushing to get their patients. These memory care patients and senior patients out of that assisted care living center and to safety, they were able to evacuate everyone. When we spoke to them, they said everyone was out and they all left as well. But this is how dynamic this situation is. When the wind is blowing this hard, with this much force, with fire and embers, you can see how how fast they're able to move, why this fire is able to jump a road and light fires on the other side of these big concrete barriers. It is a very difficult situation for firefighters to actually get a handle on because these spot fires, they can't concentrate on them. They have to go and fight the larger fires that are burning through buildings and damaging and threatening homes. So the situation out here, very dynamic. And right now we're just seeing a lot of thick smoke, lots of fires, cars that are on fire, and people really Colleen, just trying to get out of here as fast as they can. We'll send it back to you guys. Are there any firefighters or first responders that you can see up in that area? Absolutely, Colleen. So what's interesting is the smoke is so thick you can't see them, but you can hear them. That is how thick this smoke is. But we have seen tons of first responders, firefighters and police officers going door to door knocking on these apartment buildings, knocking on the businesses and making sure that everyone is getting out. Because when I say how quickly this came through, this came through so fast. People were looking at blue skies or cloudy skies, and then all of a sudden it turned dark. Within a matter of seconds. Here's one of those fire engines heading, I believe, toward the school. Earlier, just before you came to us, we saw several of those fire engines heading toward Palisades Charter High School, which again, a city worker told us had caught fire just moments ago. All right. We will again try to get confirmation on whether that is actually true or not. But in the meantime, Darsha stay safe on the phone here with us now is Mike Meadows, who is near the mastro's there on PCH. You got a view of the flames in the hills just above there? Yes, sir. I was here. I saw a spot fire start right along Pacific Coast Highway, and in probably 7 to 8 minutes, the entire hillside was just really roaring with fire. I don't know if you can see the glowing embers up there now, but at the top of this mountain are three beautiful homes. And of course, you can't see them now. The two Sikorsky twin rotor helicopters came in and tried to put this fire up, but it was no good. We've got about 40 knot winds blowing down PCH right now. And this fire is well over by Topanga Canyon Boulevard right now. This is really I mean, other than Tracey Leong. Live shot just a moment ago. And this this is the first confirmation that we have that the flames have reached PCH. Absolutely, Colleen. And I mean, they they reached it in a hurry. Like I said, it was just a simple spot fire. And I drove down to the parking lot to see if it would spread. And it certainly did. I got I got this entire hillside. I mean, it was really spectacular. I've been at this about 45, maybe 50 years, and I've never seen PCH burn like this. If you can't, at least describe to us the view that you have now versus let's say, 20, 25 minutes ago, if things intensified, are they are they calmed down? Yeah. The view I have now is pretty docile. You can still see the smoke being blown by the real strong winds, but this entire area that you're looking at was just seething. Sea of fire probably. I mean, and of course, it's this down here is the light fuel. This is not the heavy fuel. And it burned a lot quicker. And you can see the wind blowing all the embers off the hillside. But it was just solid fire. But it took about ten minutes, maybe 15, for the whole thing to burn out. And everything's gone. Mike, you mentioned you'd been at this 40 plus years. Can you explain to our viewers what you mean by that? I've been a fire photographer. I worked for a local newspaper, and I was breaking news, and one of my fortes, I guess you could say, was, was shooting fires. And I'm pretty well known with the city and county fire departments. But you know what? I am getting along in years now. But this I just couldn't I just couldn't leave this alone. I had to come out here. And I was really I mean, it's I can't. Basically say that I've been in winds any stronger than this. I mean, my, my car was rocking and rolling while I was trying to shoot this, but it's gone and it's headed in another direction right now. This fire is blowing to the north right now up PCH. As a matter of fact, I've got I've got a spot fire right next to my car and Mastro's parking lot. I don't know if you want me to pan over to it or not, but I certainly can. Well, if you would. And while Mike, while you're doing that, we're going to explain what you're seeing on the right side of the screen here we talk about the flames at PCH. They've now crossed PCH. This is actually a lifeguard tire tower that looks like it's gone. Yeah. We yeah yeah I can I can see what you're looking at. If I can pan this just started right here in the in the brush in the parking lot here. It's going pretty good. But you can you can see Colleen by the wind, I mean that nothing has a chance with the wind like this. Blowing fire like it's doing. That's the best way to put it. Nothing stands a chance in winds like this. My gosh Mike. All right. Yeah. Thank you. And I'll tell you thank goodness for all the firefighters. I mean I don't know how many companies are out here, but I can guarantee you there's at least 50 or 60 maybe companies. And they're they're fighting fire ten miles away from me as well as down here. Mike, are you seeing any choppers overhead? Any aerial assault? Can they fly in this kind of wind? Yeah. Colleen, when this thing first started, when this hillside started taking off, I. We had the two ch 53 double rotor helicopters come in, and they tried their best. But you know what? Dropping into a 40 not win the water they were dropping over the fire. But by the time the water hit the ground it was it was 3 or 400 yards to the north or, you know, to the west. They did a job. They did a good job of keeping it from crossing the road. But again, this fire was just too big and moving too fast. So hopefully those three homes up on top of that hill buried in that smoke up there, survived. I know there was some fire companies up there, so hopefully they survived. But the fire now is well past me to the to the west. And I'll tell you what it was. It was it was it's something that's probably it's probably in my top ten of fires. Well, Mike, before we let you go, you're in the Mastro's parking lot. There on PCH. Mastro's itself. The structure not suffered any damage at this point. Not at this time. I'm looking at a fire. If I can pan down here, there's fire. There's the restaurant itself and there's a fire next to it down there. Hopefully they'll they'll get this in and get it out. But anyway, yeah this was I'll tell you what I did send in some video of this entire hillside just blowing it away. But you know what? Again, it's not cold. It's relatively warm down there. It's a warm wind, but it's just full of smoke and sparks and, and what have you. We can absolutely see that in your video. Mike Meadows, thanks so much for your time and your expertise. I, I know you've covered fires for decades here in Southern California. Thank you Colleen I appreciate it. All right. Take care. All right. All right. So Mike's picture there on the left Mastro's parking lot along PCH again. Lifeguard lifeguard tower. There on fire there. And again, something you likely wouldn't expect considering where the fire started. But again, we talk about those winds, those gusts, those embers. Think about the embers. They cross PCH, they hit the water. They hit a sandy beach and they hit like this one piece of wood structure on the beach. And that of course, is the lifeguard tower. NBC 4's Camilla Rambaldi is live in a neighborhood right now where at least one home has burned, and apparently they were able to save another one. Their Camilla Colleen. That's right. When I first spoke with you guys earlier, this home over here was engulfed in flames. Since then, fire crews arrived on scene here and were able to put out those flames and save the home right next door. Earlier, I talked about how that homeowner came by to check her home. She was really worried. She was telling us how worried she was about how close those flames were to her property. But it appears that fire crews were able to spare her home. Again. Earlier. These flames were just taking over this entire home. As we were watching it burn and that intense smoke that was taking over the area and it appears now that there may be another spot fire towards the back of the home, but it's very difficult to see right now. But I say that just because of the amount of smoke that is behind there, I believe that is where firefighters are right now. But again, the concerns of those wind gusts picking back up right now. So you can just tell the just feel the intensity of these winds and the concerns of more spot fires potentially starting and flames just jumping to other homes in this area. But for now, this home right here, they were able to put out those flames and save this home next door. Colleen Michael Camilla, it's remarkable. I was just telling Colleen that this was the same house that we showed no more than 30 minutes ago that was fully engulfed. You could see the flames coming out through the windows. And you spoke to the homeowner who lives to the right of this property, who obviously evacuated but yet had no idea the status of her home. Yeah. So she obviously, as you said, evacuated but still does not know the status of her home right now. But the progress that was made here in in those last 30 minutes was remarkable to see because when we got here, those flames were so intense. And again, that homeowner those flames were so incredibly close to her home. But thankfully they were able to put out those flames. I want to go ahead and toss it over to some. We spoke earlier to several homeowners in this area who told us they actually stayed behind to help other homes, and they actually told us that they put they helped put out some fires. Let's go ahead and listen to what they had to say. A lot of flames, a lot of smoke, a lot of wind. You know, it's been very catastrophic. And as you know, everyone knows embers jump ahead as the wind blows. So they jump ahead of the fire and they catch things on fire. It's just there's fire all the way around us, all the way around us. Yeah. Literally. You turn around one second, you're looking at the fire, look back while your firefighter look back again. It's actually moved hundreds of feet in seconds. It goes that quick. Those embers go and poof. Fire. Because no rain. Again, as he talked about those embers flying and just the concern with that due to these intense winds. But as you just heard, people helping people doing what they can to help other homeowners in this area, but, you know, back out here live again, one home, at least here was spared this afternoon from those intense flames next door. I'll go ahead and send it back to you. All right, bill Camilla, thank you for that. We want to tell you now it is 430 straight up. We are continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. We have been on the air bringing you live continuous coverage since 11 a.m. This fire is currently burning more than 1200 acres in the Pacific Palisades area. There are closures out there. There are evacuations. More than 30,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, some leaving their cars, just abandoning them in the middle of the road. Looking at that video right there, those winds only expected to worsen tonight with more than 10,000 homes threatened. We do want to remind our viewers an evacuation shelter has been established at Westwood Recreation Center. This is over at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. And this is exactly what they had to do with those cars. They brought in a bulldozer. They bulldozed those cars, those abandoned cars out of the area so that first responders and fire crews could get in there. NBC 4's Robert Kovacik live there on Sunset Boulevard, near where people were being evacuated, and Robert Homes up in the hills are burning. There. Yeah, just as you heard it is just complete catastrophe everywhere you look. You just don't know what you're going to see here. And this is right here at the Highlands. And as you see a home there on fire, Scott's going to whip around here. And you see right now, basically the Highlands Village has been completely spared though the hills behind it have been charred. So the firefighting effort has been a hopscotch, if you will. You can still see some flames right here as you head up Palisades. And then we're going to take you as you see the firefighting effort. We're going to take a walk here and be very careful, because the firefighting effort not only goes on, but so do the evacuations. And every now and then you're going to see the LAPD march people down here in their cars. But we want to show you here, as you see, that the winds have picked up considerably. The smoke continues to be an issue. There have been still evacuations. And we watched right now as they try and get people still out of this area. And we have talked about how difficult sometimes it is to maneuver out of these spaghetti streets, because these are very narrow and tough streets. So you see right here you have an entire condominium complex. And look at the fire there that is raging behind it. We don't see any firefighting efforts there. But look at that fire pick up, and you just don't know if they can possibly get to it. The winds are pushing it right now. And Colleen and Michael, right before we came to you, saw a firefighter that I've worked with for decades. I said, what's going on? And he said, it's all going to the beach. He said, everything right now is pushing towards the beach, and that is what we're witnessing. But let us take you down here and really give you an idea of the panic and the fear that must have set in for people you showed a few minutes ago. The bulldozer that was coming, that was pushing these cars out of the way. This is the bulldozer that's here, just in case this bulldozer is needed again. So the L.A. County Fire Department, this is Sunset and Palisades, where you see right here. Still, the firefighting effort. Still you see fire trucks, still you see LAPD officers trying to direct traffic, trying to get people out of here. But this is the aftermath of all of these cars that were abandoned. And you can see right now how important it was. Look at that fire truck heading east on sunset. Now, having to get through the cars that they pushed out of the way. How are we doing, gentlemen? Evacuation still happening? Any injuries that you're hearing about? So far, so good. Okay, LAPD confirming evacuations underway. So look right there. This is a fire truck, right? Right here. Looks like it says Hermosa Beach. If I if I can see on that truck, this is what is the path that they had to clear out because so many cars had suddenly had to be abandoned. So many cars had blocked. Sunset here at Highland and the Palisades that they had to move these cars out of the way. So Redondo Beach is here on scene in this firefighting effort. But wherever you look, you can turn 360 degrees. You will see smoke, you will see fire. You will see a destroyed home, and you will see an effort that only continues because right now you just don't know where you can possibly go to try and stop this thing from moving. But again, to quote our guys from the LAFD, this fire right now is heading towards the beach and it continues to burn. Right now I'm going to show you right here with the Highlands. This is a condominium complex, an apartment complex that definitely has to be an area of concern right now because we are watching the flames behind it. We're going to keep our eye on it for you and we'll keep you posted. All right, Robert, thank you. We have an update on on that situation. It's not going to the beach. It's at the beach right now. We're going to switch live to NBC 4's. Tracey Leong. She is live along PCH near Will Rogers State Beach. Tracey. We understand you're seeing police evacuating people there. Yeah that's right. Colleen, just within the last ten minutes, we saw officers jump out of their patrol cars right here along PCH. They ran across the highway and they ran up that hillside to those homes that appear to be burning right now. The trees are burning. You can see those flames just taking over that one wall. We saw these two officers and they were yelling. They appeared to be talking to someone. They were telling them to get out. They were asking if they were okay. It's unclear. We couldn't see someone on the other side, but the cops were communicating with someone. And then just shortly after that, they jumped the fence and they are now inside that complex where there are just dozens of homes on this hillside, Colleen and Michael. And you can see right now live on television, this home is burning down. And that is the home that the officers were trying to get to. We also saw other people who parked their cars, and they were trying to get someone out of there. I believe they waved the cops down to alert them that they believe people are still inside these homes and these flames. They are just moving so rapidly. These winds are so strong. They are blowing all this smoke in the area. Visibility is very low. It is difficult to see. It is difficult to breathe. We have seen fire trucks and police officers coming back along PCH. And again, a lot of people right now are trying to evacuate. They are trying to just get out of the area. So this is one of the main roads that people can use to access to get out. And again, we are already seeing these flames coming down. They've reached the beach and I'm not sure if you can hear right now. You can hear these officers yelling. My photographer, Sean Browning, he's taking you over here right now. So these two officers, these are the two men that we saw run up that hillside. And it does. Sean, it does look like there's someone up there. It looks like there's someone up on the hillside. There's two people. I'm not sure if those are fire rescue crews, but they are trying to get inside this home that is actively burning. Colleen and Michael. And so these officers came back down. And if we get a little bit closer, was there someone inside? Was there someone inside? Okay. Not not sure. There might be someone up there, but you can see this home is just crumbling from these intense flames. And there are just dozens of homes behind there. But we're going to keep an eye on this situation for now. That's the very latest. Colleen. Michael, back to you. Wow. All right. Tracey again, get some water. Catch your breath. The elements out there obviously doing a number on. Yeah. And you can see the house there when it goes. It goes quickly. We did see two people in the backyard there. One appeared to be in civilian clothes. The other one might have been in uniform, but it was really hard to tell through all that smoke. The hope is that nobody is inside of that home or anywhere near that home. All right. NBC 4's Darsha Philips with more on some houses burning there on Radcliffe Avenue. Yeah. Michael. Colleen. We actually see maybe about six homes here on Radcliffe just going up in flames. We came down the street. We thought it was just two, but take a long look down here. Almost every single home on this side of the street has gone up in flames, completely destroyed this one. Actively burning right now. The one next to it. Also actively burning. And then just further down the road, we were able to walk down there. They're just skeletons of homes right now. So this is how quickly this fire is moving. We are not far from Pacific Palisades Charter High School, so that's where we are located. And right now we do believe that everyone on this street has been evacuated, which is the good news. Sadly, though, homes, people are going to be coming back to skeletons of homes not able to come back home after this. But take a look how hot this fire is burning right now. It is burning through so much and the wind continues to whip through this area. One thing I do want to mention, we do not see a firefighter in sight, and that is because this is so difficult to get a handle on. These fires are moving like a blowtorch with this wind, and the firefighters are struggling to keep up with it. Take a look at this over here. That's going up in just the past five minutes. We saw something burning on the other side of this area. I believe that's Haverford over there. It looks like a power line is on fire, along with some trees and brush. But again, just really very close to structures. So we are seeing homes lost here in this fire. And again, first responders, we've seen them rushing around this area trying to get everyone out of the area, get them evacuated and to safety. That of course, is the number one priority for these first responders. And then of course, trying to save property. But the fast moving flames, how fast this wind is blowing makes it completely difficult for first responders to really get a handle on this. And again, we are also seeing hearing explosions. A lot of those are tires of cars that are on fire. We did also see a gas line blow here in one of these homes. So a very dynamic situation. As I mentioned before, we are seeing homes that are burning actively here on Radcliffe. We'll send it back to you guys. Darsha Philips there again reporting live there for us in Radcliffe. Thought in the beginning, initially there were two homes on fire. She counted as many as 5 or 6. Yes. And nobody appears to be in the neighborhood. Darsha nobody appears to be in the neighborhood. We do have several media. Who's here? You know, just discovering that this is on fire. But we do not see anyone actively evacuating. So the hope is everyone was able to get out with their pets and with their loved ones. But again, I think what is so eerie is that we actually do not see any first responders here. And it's not because they don't want to be here, it's because this is moving so quickly that they are having to continue to try and save the property and the life that they can. This is a chimney that is smoking right here. The fire has gotten into the attic and in through the rest of the home. And now it's that that smoke you see just pouring out of the chimney. It's really devastating to see these homes go up. You know, people who left their homes thinking that they'd be able to come back to a home, maybe just leaving with the clothes on their back and then having to come back to this is going to be devastating. It's going to be very difficult for so many of these folks. And again, like I said, we just saw two houses. At first. We walked down the road a little bit and it just continues to go on and on. At least 5 or 6 homes that have been burned. Colleen Michael, we'll send it back to you. Again, that's Radcliffe Avenue, and because it is moving so quickly, we're going to advise you to move out of the neighborhood as well. All right. Meteorologist Melissa Magee is back with another look at the. Of course, the First Alert forecast. And of course the winds. Yeah. It's really dangerous. I mean, just looking at those images with Darsha, Colleen and Michael. Typically we're talking about wildfire or this brush fire, and we're talking about containment in that area. Looking at her live pictures there, it's not just containment with the original fire source and that location, but also containment in terms of getting ahead of these hotspots. So now you've got flying embers falling on top of homes, on top of structures, just to really devastating situation there near the Palisades. So let's go back to the original source and just show you the observation data in that area. Look at these winds. We've got Topanga Beach up to 43mph. Santa Monica mountains up to 62mph. So this is a wind driven fire that we're tracking. It's a topography driven fire as well. And now, not only do we have the topography in the sense that we're dealing with the hills and the foothills in that area, we've got a lot of dry fuel. Part of that fuel, the lifeguard station that we're seeing, the homes that we're seeing in that area, as well as the dry brush and the grass on the ground. Add on top of that the weather. In this situation, it's all about the Santa Ana winds. Those Santa Ana winds make this situation even more dangerous as we go throughout the rest of the afternoon. It's not just for the Palisades. I want to show you the relative humidity across much of Southern California. Earlier today, when we were tracking the fire in the very latest, with the conditions, we had relative humidity anywhere from 30 to about 45% across our entire area. It's dropping and it's dropping quickly. Look at this. We're down into the teens for Lancaster, Van Nuys, 13%, 21% there in West Covina. And we're down to 18% for the Basin. So what does that mean in terms of fires in Santa Ana's? When you get these northeasterly winds that come through the canyons in the passes and going all the way down to the coast, all the way down to the beach, that Santa Ana wind, it warms, it compresses at the surface, and it dries out the atmosphere significantly. And we're starting to see more images pop up on the screen. Just to the left of me, I want to show you what to expect as we go throughout the rest of tonight. So we're tracking current conditions, the peak of the wind yet to arrive. So for the rest of the afternoon, from now until about 8 or 9:00, we've got winds anywhere from 20 to 50mph. Santa Monica mountains. It's a little higher than that for you. So power outages is a big concern. Structure fires, brush fires, downed trees. And then once we get into the peak intensity of this wind event, that's between 10 p.m. Tonight until Wednesday, 5:00 in the morning. So we're calling for winds anywhere from 60 to 80mph across much of our area. Then you head up to the mountains. Then we'll have winds anywhere from 65 to 85mph, plus some isolated spots a little stronger than that. And then tomorrow morning we've got that other burst of wind coming on through. So it's not just the high wind warning for all of our region, and even for areas that are typically wind sheltered. Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Altadena, the Basin, as well as much of our area here. So we've got this red flag warning until 6 p.m. On Thursday evening because the Santa Ana winds drying out the atmosphere, as we're seeing, unfortunately, this afternoon, this will elevate our extreme fire danger as we go throughout the rest of the evening. That's the very latest with our weather and this windstorm that we're tracking. We've got more to come in just a little bit. I'll send it back over your way. All right, Melissa, before we let you go here, we talk about the peak winds here tonight, ranging from, what, 10 p.m. Tonight until 5 a.m. Wednesday morning. That's right. Right. So that's the. That's a long stretch of time, Michael, where we're tracking very extensive winds and winds that we've yet to see so far. Our season, which is why the National Weather Service is using terminology like they're using because they want people to be prepared. So in a situation with the Palisades Fire, unfortunately, this serves as a reminder to be ready, set, go. In a situation like this. Ready? Preparing ahead of time. When the set happens. This is when you heed those warnings and take, you know, take consideration of the evacuation orders and then go is go. When you see the flames and the fires coming in your area. So this unfortunately, is serving as a reminder of what we need to do and how we need to prepare in the hours to come. Until this event wraps up, we talk about a fire exploding. If you think about the fact that this started at 1030 this morning, that's only six, almost 6.5 hours, right? And we've seen this kind of destruction. It's incredible. Colleen and we were just talking about that, you know, when we were on the air, it was just a couple of acres at 1030 in the morning. And then it grew to about 200, 300. And now we have more than 1200 acres on top of the fact that you're dealing with residents who have homes that are burning, cars that are burning. So this all speaks to the magnitude of how intense those winds are as they come through rushing through those mountains, the canyons in the passes. So it kind of acts like a funnel. I don't know if you guys have ever been in tall buildings, and you're trying to walk through tall buildings. Once you walk through that pathway, it gets extremely cold and windy. Imagine that high up in the upper levels of the atmosphere. So all of that wind comes racing down from the mountains, down to the canyons, and passes all the way down to the Basin and the coast here in the Palisades. So we're tracking the conditions, significant wind event. That's why it's so dangerous. That's why it's so strong because of the level of the winds. All right Melissa more to come. All right. Appreciate it. Thank you. A homeowner that we met named Stuart talked to our Alex Rozier earlier near Glen Haven Drive. Take a listen. Well, it started out as a brush fire pretty far up the hill, but with the winds, I had a feeling it was going to be driven down into all the neighborhoods. And it's starting to happen. This is Lockman, and it's burned sort of around this knoll for some reason. We're on a ridge, but it's burned down into Palisades Drive down into that canyon, and it's gone over to Bienvenida, down that canyon. So there's that school, Saint Matthews, over there, and Calvary on Palisades Drive. Both, I'm sure, are evacuated. So schools and homes impacted a number of neighbors have already evacuated. What was your plan here? Right now? Just if there', like a little ember driven fire right around the house so that we can deal with. We'll do that. You know, if it if it fills in really hot and heavy, we're out of here, obviously. And you can likely hear the wind that's hitting our microphone right now. You said you've lived in the neighborhood for decades. Yeah. Has it ever gotten this close to your your family's homes? It's never gotten this close to. Yeah, not our house down by the village and not this home on Lockman. It's. It's been in the Highlands. We lived there for a little while. It's been around, but it's never burned. This area, as you stand here, the wind's blowing the smoke around us. What's going through your mind? It's. It's a strong wind. It's stronger than normal. So that's what drives the fire. There could be an ember a half mile away, and it catches the wind. And it lands over here and starts a whole new deal. I've seen several of them just start out out of nowhere, like a big plume took off over to our right. And it's like there goes another one. So if something like that were to land around us, we could put it out. That would be great. But if not, we'll get out of here. They mentioned the key word here, and that is spotting. This morning. No one thought this would be on the beach, but it has crossed over PCH as we've seen already. David and Colleen, the long range spotting of this fire is all due to the wind. It's carrying any ember that's being put up and essentially moving it hundreds of thousands of feet, if not potentially about a mile or so out ahead of the fire, which is sparking additional fires, making it difficult to keep up with. Here's a look at the current observations. You can see that in the mountains right now we're seeing gusts up to 62 miles an hour down by the beach. We're still seeing pretty good gusts up to 40 to 45 miles an hour. And through parts of Pacific Palisades, we've got some gusts up into the 20 to 30 mile per hour range. We're talking about spotting. We're talking about these small embers going off and starting small fires in other locations. This is an example of it that actually happened during the Bridge Fire. Remember that that was near the mountain high area. So the fire was in the trees here. But I want you to pay attention to this meadow. I'm going to play this out in real time. As it happened on one of the cameras. You see all this debris that's going by the camera shot right here? This is all just being kicked up by the wind. Some of this is ash. Some of this, though, are embers. And once they hit this dry grass, you'll notice a bunch of spot fires starting up here. See all these individual spot fires and it doesn't take very long. Pay attention to the time here on the right side of the screen. It doesn't take very long for each of these individual spot fires to suddenly flare up, and it starts igniting this entire area, which is also helping to preheat it ahead of the fire that's coming out of the trees. And before you know it, by the time we get to about 25 seconds here, we've got a whole bunch of this area starting to light up, and then this will become engulfed with fire, probably within the next 30 to 40s or so. So that is the main concern. And we still have that tonight because we're still looking at another period of some very gusty winds for much of the region, including Pacific Palisades. This is an hour by hour forecast here. You can see that over the next couple of hours. We still have some pretty decent gusts in the 30 to 40 mile per hour range. But suddenly as we get closer and closer to midnight, it's that time frame we've been talking about 10 p.m. To about 5 a.m. You'll see that the gusts intensity suddenly cranks up, and we're potentially looking at gusts in the 40 to 50 mile per hour range, or even stronger. So not only are we concerned about the potential for embers being spread by this gusty wind, we're also now going to be concerned about trees potentially coming down. That's a concern that we have across the entire region with this. As the winds pick up right now, you can already see we've got some pretty strong wind gusts out there. Look at Van Nuys gusting up to 43 miles an hour right now for Santa Clarita. We've got gusts into the 50 mile per hour range. Currently 54 mile per hour gusts. And we're seeing these gusts in areas that are typically a little wind sheltered during Santa Ana wind events, such as around LAX 36 mile per hour gusts. Right now, we've got 20 mile per hour gusts around West Covina. Ontario airport is gusting to nearly 50 miles an hour. And again, this will intensify as we go through the next few hours. As you take a look across Ventura County into the San Fernando Valley here, we're going to start at 8 p.m. Tonight. As we get closer to midnight, look at some of these gusts around some parts of the valley. Burbank gusting up above 60 miles an hour, 40 to 50 mile per hour gusts for Simi Valley and Porter Ranch. Even stronger in the mountains. This our other concern down here, south of the Santa Monica mountains that includes the Pacific Palisades area, potentially looking at gusts 40 to 50 miles an hour. And this will go through the overnight into tomorrow morning. This is 7 a.m. Look at the gusts around Malibu. Look at the gusts around Point Mugu. Look at the gusts around Moorpark. Very strong wind gusts 40 to 50 miles an hour or even stronger. And again, it's not only the fire concern that we're that we're worried about. It's also the potential for trees to come down. Tree damage, trees potentially falling into power lines that could spark another fire. So there's a whole lot that we're going to have to pay attention to as we go through the overnight. This is just the very start of this wind event. All right. Just the start. All right David appreciate it. Thank you. Joining us on the phone now is Adam Handler who abandoned his car earlier today. And that's exactly where Robert is. Adam, before we get to the property here, how are you doing? Well, we're all fine. My wife and I and our dog are fine. We evacuated and we're with some friends in West LA. And as far as we know, our house is fine to car does not seem to be so fine. Adam, we understand you were driving a black Audi. Is that the first one? That's right there at the. At the beginning of the dozer? Yeah, that looks like the car. Yeah. That's it. So describe to us the driver's license. Yeah. What happened? Why did you why did you have to get out and go? So we were my wife and I were in the car with our dog. And, you know, we thought everything was going to be fine. We were just going to go down sunset to PCH and just get out of there. But the flames started like palm trees near us, started catching on fire, and then some flames came down the hill to the point where there may be like 10 or 15ft away and either a fireman or a policeman. I think it was a policeman started telling everybody get out of your car if you want to live. And he wasn't, you know, telling everybody, get out of your car, leave things, leave the car. You need to go now or or or the fire is going to burn you. That had to be terrifying. It was pretty terrifying. And, you know, the smoke was really thick and there were, like, burning embers on the ground. And it was pretty, pretty scary. So you're given those instructions by LAPD, I presume. What do you do at that point? You obviously abandoned the car. Where do you go? So we actually had had my wife and I were both out. So we had both come back. And that was my wife was driving that car and I couldn't get to her. So I parked on PCH and I walked up to her like about a mile or a mile and a half. And so I had gotten to her. So we actually had another car. So we walked down PCH to the other car and that's that's the car we took. So we were lucky in having a car, but we were running into like neighbors and friends who were who were, you know, walking and getting out of there. Adam, do you know the status of your home tonight? As far as we know, for some people who haven't evacuated, the house is fine and doesn't seem to be in any immediate trouble. It's our house is at the top of the hill, right next to the pump station. The LADWP pump station. So. But from people we know who are up there, the that particular area of the Highlands seems to be okay. I feel really bad for people further down the hill who was like a terrible. Why did you choose? You and your wife choose to evacuate. You still have neighbors who are there in the neighborhood. What prompted you to say it's time to get out? Well, we didn't have a choice because we weren't at the house. Our I c was there and she brought the dog down and then left, but we couldn't get back up to the house. But pretty sure we would have evacuated anyhow because. Why risk it? Good answer. I mean, when I was a kid, when I was a kid, my house burned down. And so that was a pretty horrific experience. I wasn't there at the time. But. You know, it's fire is no joke. Adam, how quickly did all of this happen for you? I mean, we've we've heard people who say, you know, it was 15 minutes. It was 30 minutes. It was less than an hour. How quickly did you make that decision that you needed to get everybody, you know, out of your house? Well, like I said, we weren't in the house, but I think. But your housekeeper. Yeah. So we told her, you know, as soon as we were, you know, we were seeing tentative evacuation orders. That that it was time for her to leave, get out of there, because we wanted to make sure that, you know, she was safe and her dog was safe. So, you know, we told her to leave as soon as we started getting the temporary evacuation orders. And. You know, we were actually trying to get back up to the house, but we would have just got up there, you know, grabbed the dog and some valuables and just left. I mean, we wouldn't we wouldn't have stayed around. Other people seem unconcerned. I mean. Before we let you go, we have just a couple of seconds here. Have you made the call to the insurance company at all? I sent them an email. Have you heard back? I have not heard back yet, but I haven't checked. But. You know, hopefully it's covered. I'm not sure what the rules are for. When you were told by the police to abandon your car that a bulldozer comes and gets it a little unusual, I'm not sure either. There may be some fine print, but we're not sure. So please, please keep us updated for sure. Yeah. All right. Thank you. All right. Good to hear you're safe. All right. Thank you very much, Adam. All right. It's just about 5:00, and we're continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Good evening once again, everybody. I'm Michael Brownlee, and I'm Colleen Williams. Thanks so much for joining us tonight. We've been covering this fire since it broke out, bringing you live coverage since about 11 a.m. This morning. Homes destroyed in a dangerous wildfire burning in Pacific Palisades. Evacuation shelters have been set up as residents were forced to leave at a moment's notice and get to safety. I grabbed everything as fast as possible, hopped in the car and then waited on Palisades Drive. I did attempt to go down Palisades Drive, but it was like a tornado of fire all around me. Firefighters are hard at work, and some residents say they have never seen anything like this. How long have you lived in the neighborhood? 30 years. This is the closest that you've seen it to your house? Yeah. NBC 4 news at five starts with breaking news. Well, that fire is currently burning more than 1200 acres in the Pacific Palisades area, prompting closures and evacuations. More than get this, 30,000 people have been forced to evacuate, some actually leaving their cars in the middle of the road. And we've seen one lifeguard tower there on fire, and that's what we're looking at right there. The winds only expected to get worse tonight with more than 10,000 homes threatened. We continue our live team coverage with NBC 4's, Darsha, Karma Dickerson. She is live in a neighborhood right now where homes are. You can see burning directly behind her. The fire continues underway here on Lockman Lane. Now, depending on where you are, you might see a part of the street that's completely clear. Or you might see a scene like the one we have behind me. We've seen at least four different homes just on this stretch of Lockman. It's the 1400 block that are in some state of burning to the ground. This is one we've been focusing on for most of the day. After we saw the flames come up within a matter of minutes, and firefighters really be taking a I don't want to say off guard, but they realized pretty quickly that there was not much they could do to stop this home from burning. And so they focus on their efforts on making sure the fire did not spread to any other nearby homes. The winds so strong in this case that the flames overtook the home. It appeared from the rear pretty quickly and moved its way forward. And now we see there's not much left of it. Not much of a roof, not much of the foundation or the framework. Nevertheless, firefighters are working on all sides to make sure this doesn't blow to the house next to it. We talked with the woman who lives next door, and she says they basically been watching in terror, wanting to see what was going to happen next. Fortunately, it looked like the winds are blowing the fire away from her home. Nevertheless, she's not sure of what to do next because there are not many options for getting out of the neighborhood at this point. The there are so many fire crews on the ground. The smoke is so heavy, their fire hoses. It's not really a safe area to be out driving around. So really they're hunkered down, hoping for the best right now and just listening for what their next steps should be. We do want to show you what happened as we first came to this house, as it was burning, though a little bit of a Bright Spot, if you can call it that. Firefighters coming out with the belongings of the residents in their hands. They were carrying photo albums. They were carrying what looked like antiques. They carried out a grandfather clock and I asked what was going on, and they said, we're just trying to save something, trying to do what we can. Maybe this will give them a little bit of comfort. That was the sentiment as they walked out of this house with the few things that they were able to save. Now these flames have been going strong since at least about 245. So to give you an idea, this is really just been consistent. Despite the efforts of firefighters actively fighting this fire, these flames have not relented and the wind is just one of the big reasons why there simply wasn't much they can do. What they have been able to do, though, is make sure it hasn't spread beyond this, beyond this particular home. If we want to show you, though, a little bit further down the road is what we are dealing with with the winds. Another home burning in the distance there again, this is the 1400 block of Lockman, and we continue to see this street be an area where there are there are a lot of spot fires. There are a lot of crews actively working to stop homes burning. But yes, there have been several homes lost just along this particular stretch of the roadway. The smoke is thick, it's heavy, it's hard to breathe. It's hard to see. And it really has been a pretty relentless for hours. This has been the situation on this part of the road. Most people in this area are gone every now and then. We do see a homeowner stick their head out. And so we're trying to make sure people know that they are supposed to be keeping this area clear. But if they haven't at this point, there's not a lot of options that people have. As a matter of fact, I do see a gentleman here. I just want to ask if we can ask what brings him out. Hi sir, my name is Karma. I'm a reporter with NBC. I'm so glad to see you're okay. I've been seeing you stick your head out. Do you live nearby? I live next door. Next door? I think I talked to your wife. She was very worried. How are you guys doing? We're okay. We might be okay. I don't know, I don't know yet. We've been watching firefighters fight on all sides around your home. What are you able to see? We got fire on all of our sides of the home. And this is the last side. So if we get lucky and this is out, we might save the home. What are your plans for this evening? As we know, these winds are not dying down anytime soon. And this fire has been burning for a couple of hours now. I'm just going to stick around and save my home. Try to save my home. What other measures are you taking? That's all I can do. Is that what you all are doing? Using your own hoses and your own water around the house? Yeah, I use the pump that pumps the water out of the pool as well. And that was very helpful. And do you have a plan for what happens if things take a turn? If things get worse? I'm just going to stay home until the last minute. Well, thank you so much for talking to us. Good luck to you tonight. Please be safe out there, guys. Is the latest from from Lockman Lane. We're on the 1400 block where homes are burning. Some residents, as you hear, are staying, but most people have left this area. I'll send it back to you. Karma. Thank you. By our count, at least three homes in that area burned since about 2:00 this afternoon. NBC 4's Robert Kovacik is live right now at Palisades and Sunset. And apparently, Robert, the flames are getting close to homes there. And an apartment complex as well. Let's show you. Colleen. I just want you to know we have an evacuation route right here that we can look clearly down this path. We only hope that the people who live in this vast apartment complex have it as well. These are the flames right here. This is the back of the Highlands complex here. And you can see already that the embers have begun to latch on to the beams and to the frames of the structure. We only hope that it can withstand the fire, because what you see here is, is not only a fire that is burning here at Palisades and Sunset, which has really just been the heart of the matter for several hours right now. But what you don't see is any firefighting effort. And that's because, honestly, they don't know where to turn first. We have seen firefighters do what they can structure protection, trying to save homes. But this is a fire, as we know, that is pushed by winds, that is pushed by these fast moving winds throughout the day. And hang on one second, I'm just going to walk right here and see if I can talk to this person. Hi. How's it going? Good. How are you? So, have you seen any evacuations here at all? Yeah. Just then. Just now? Yeah, yeah. How's it looking on the other side? Pretty hectic. Yeah. Yeah. And so, have we seen any fire on this side of the apartment complex? I don't think so. No. Just here so far. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Always appreciate your work. These are our stringers that have been working with us throughout the day and throughout the years here. So what? This is just part Colleen and Michael, of a very large. Highlands apartment complex here. It appears to be pretty much empty. Haven't seen a lot of people leave. Haven't seen a lot of people still inside. So remember we're talking about an evacuation order for all of Pacific Palisades. When was the last time we've ever said that an evacuation order for all of Pacific Palisades. These people have been told to leave. And we understand that most of them, it appears looking at this, have. But we have this apartment complex right now. And again, it stretches from this from here all the way over to Sunset and Highland. And as we come back here, we're going to go down the street with you for a second. As you continue to watch the firefighting effort. There are flames throughout both sides of the road because the embers have pushed this fire. We've talked about how the fire is already at the beach, but this is where the fire still continues to burn. We have fire trucks now, still racing. We've seen Hermosa Beach arrive here. We've seen Redondo Beach arrive here. We've seen a Point Dume lifeguards come here and try to help. And look at here. We've got the LA Fire Department running down Sunset Boulevard. This is Sunset West heading towards the beach. And right there at that intersection right here. Look at all of these cars. All of these cars, I guarantee you, are people evacuating still being pushed out of Highlands here. This complex and this neighborhood here in Pacific Palisades, one after the other cars. We saw a woman who had to leave because of the Franklin Fire. We saw other people who had to leave because this was the first fire that they've ever encountered. People who said that they are just so exhausted by this because, as Governor Newsom said in the news conference, we were just here weeks ago with with other fires, with the Franklin fire. And now here we go again. But this is a fire unlike we have ever seen in several years. A fire that exploded from this morning that forced the cars right up here on Sunset and Palisades to be evacuated by people who ran for their lives, people who feared they wouldn't get out in time, who had to abandon their cars. And you can imagine altogether, it must have just been a mass exodus. But what they did is they left their cars behind, and now most of those cars severely damaged by the bulldozers that had to push them away. So this right now for the Palisades is part of the center of the firefight. And you see right here people still trying to get out and people still evacuating, realizing that right now this fire is here to stay and it is still causing widespread damage. As we continue to look here to see what is going to happen here at the Highlands apartment complex, where the fire is now threatening. Let's go back to you. All right. Robert, thank you. Robert talked about the evacuations. What? The entire area of the Pacific Palisades evacuated, and we heard from the fire chief that that encompasses 30,000 people and well over 10,000 residences. And Robert's on one side. He's on the Sunset Boulevard side of where it connects with PCH all the way on the other side at Topanga Canyon. That's what we're looking at here. We understand this is a business that is on fire at Topanga Canyon and PCH. We're trying to get some confirmation on what business it is there, but keep in mind, that's very close to where the fire burned. That Franklin Fire not that long ago. And I can tell you, I've I've looked at some of the reports or the releases from Pepperdine. They've been through this befor, very recently, and they're keeping an eye on the situation. They say they have a plan in place just in case the flames should encroach on their area, as they did in the Franklin Fire. I mean, it got very, very close on campus there. But again, this is Topanga Canyon and PCH. All right. So as we give you this shot, we want to take you now to NBC 4's Alex Rozier. He's live for us there on Tellem and Lockman. Lane. Alex. Yeah. We've been monitoring this scene right here on Tellem near Lockman. There are a number of LA city firefighters that have been on scene about ten minutes ago, they used a saw to cut open that garage, and they've been working to put out flames ever since. A brief moments, you can see the silhouette of the firefighters that are fighting this at this home right here near Tellem and Lockman that is ongoing right now. And we've been driving around the neighborhood over the last hour. And it's a different story, block by block. I want to show you another scene that we shot about an hour and a half ago when we were at Scenic Place and Enchanted Way. There was another home there that was Catching fire, and the neighbor's house was in flames, too. As Colleen noted earlier in the broadcast, you know, this is a very densely populated residential neighborhood, and these firefighters are working with urgency to contain the fire as quickly as they can. If it hits one of these homes so that it doesn't spread to the next. And as we bring you back out, live here on Tellem Way, that's what they're working and that's what they're up against right now. But the reality is this we've been talking about it as an ambulance is passing right here, but we've been talking about it throughout the day that the winds are going to get stronger and more intense as the day goes on. And I can tell you right now, just standing out here over the last 30 minutes, the winds have definitely intensified. You can see the thick black smoke that is coming here on Tellem Way, but thankfully it appears a large majority of the people who live here have evacuated and have listened to the orders. I do want to say, in driving around over the last hour, a large majority of the homes that we saw were saved by the firefighters. At least right now. But unfortunately, there are the homes like this one, and I witnessed myself at least a handful. So these firefighters right here aggressively fighting this. And we'll bring you the latest as we have it. Look at that ember right there. Boy. And that's some of the what we've been talking about. The spotting that one didn't go far. I mean that blew off that house just a few feet. But with winds like this, you can see spotting for several miles ahead of the fire. And it's why we're seeing the fire reaching across PCH, across Pacific Coast Highway, all the way to the beach. Tonight, our Melissa Magee is talking is here with us right now. She's here to talk about some of the winds. And again, the worst is not here. According to the forecast. That's what we've been saying. And that's exactly right. Colleen and Michael, we're still tracking those strong winds that will likely move in later on tonight, overnight into our Wednesday morning. So we're not even seeing the most peak intensity in terms of the winds in terms of the latest data. More changes are happening as we speak. The winds are starting to ramp up across areas in the Palisades, as well as Topanga Beach, Santa Monica mountains. We're starting to see that relative humidity lower. Look at this. We're down to 11% there in Topanga Beach. So the atmosphere is really drying out. And it's not just the Palisades. Everybody is dealing with these strong, significant, damaging, destructive winds at this hour. Fremont Canyon, Santa Ana mountains in the foothills there, 80mph. Not really touched on Orange County or the IE because a lot of the concentration today with the strongest winds have been out across areas in LA and Ventura counties. Now, some of that wind opportunity moving in across those communities as well. Pacoima, 78mph. Saugus 55 East Simi Valley hour east of Simi Valley and at 58mph. Then I put LAX on here and at 44mph, because typically lacks is wind sheltered. When you're talking about a Santa Ana wind event, they don't typically get on the activity. But because this is so widespread, you're starting to see why this is damaging. Tonight, I want to show you the current wind gusts across the region. Santa Clarita. We've got gusts up to 54mph. A gust there in Santa Ana, up to 46mph. But then I want you to concentrate on the colors here. We've got purples, we've got lavender. We even have red. That's an indication of winds anywhere from 50 to about 70mph or higher. Also, the relative humidity is starting to lower as well. Red flag warnings have been posted even after the most intense winds move in and move out of our region. Red flag warning stays up until 6 p.m. On Thursday, and relative humidity is dropping down into the teens in some spots where earlier today and earlier this morning, we had a relative humidity, anywhere from about 30 to about 45%. That's changing. Storm reports to tell you about, in the sense that we've got a lot of damaging winds moving in across areas and across communities here. So near Beverly Hills, we had a tree that was reported down in the road close to Beverly will drive in between Cisco and Beverly Wood, Rancho Cucamonga. We had a semi truck overturn on the freeways there. Running springs and even areas in San Bernardino County. We had winds anywhere from 70 to 77mph. Let's talk about what's to come as we go throughout the rest of tonight. Wind gusts. Futurecast showing you 7 p.m. Tonight. Not even in the thick of it right now, but we're starting to see those gusts pop up in Pomona. Up to 44mph. Then 10:00. We've been talking about the height of the winds moving on through 10 p.m. Overnight into 5 a.m. On Wednesday. That's when these winds will be even stronger than what they are right now. So the concern is still there. Rapid fire growth is still there as well. Look at some of these gusts. 10:00 tonight we'll have winds gusting up to 44mph in San Bernardino, close to 40 in Riverside, gusting in the San Gabriel Valley, in the mountains here, anywhere from 70mph or higher. Then we go throughout the overnight hours and into our Wednesday morning, 5:00 in the morning. This is still a factor in terms of those very strong winds. So red flag warnings do stay up across our region. A drop in that humidity as we go throughout the rest of tonight. And this is a long duration Santa Ana wind event, which is rapidly spreading. These fires as we're seeing now in the Palisades. And we'll continue to watch what's to come for the rest of tonight. Coleen and Michael, I'll send it back over your way. All right, Melissa, we're going to put up a picture on the screen here. I want you to take a close look at it. I understand this is a camera that's positioned at LAX. It's pointed towards the Palisades area. Now, we always say fire looks worse at night because you can really see it. In this case, there's no getting worse at night. This is a fire that has burned over 1200 acres so far. That number we heard at about 430 this afternoon. No, no doubt it has grown 30,000 people affected here, 30,000 people evacuated, 10,000 households in the in the danger zone. As we say here. In fact, as Robert Kovacik put it just a few minutes ago, when is the last time you've heard that all of Pacific Palisades is evacuated? We've seen, I would say, Michael, at least a dozen homes go up in flames this afternoon. That's by our count. There's no containment on this fire so far and no specific number on the number of homes burned. But again, this will just give you an idea of the magnitude of what we're talking about here. This fire stretches from Sunset Boulevard all the way to Topanga Boulevard. And it has crossed over PCH. It has burned at least one lifeguard tower and has threatened it was burning in the parking lot of Mastro's. Just to give you an idea of a landmark, if you're familiar with the area and you talk about, you know, the number of structures that at least we have seen destroyed, this fire has become a much more aggressive with each minute. I mean, it's gotten with our coverage. We've seen more destruction, more damage. So again, this is a 12 acre brush fire now 12 acres. 1200 acres. Plus, it started at 1030 this morning with a ten acre brush fire. So you can talk about how fast this has grown over the course of, you know, six plus hours. We do not use the word explodes lightly here. This one really did explode. But once again, we wanted to give you an idea of the magnitude of this fire. This is a camera at LAX pointed towards the Palisades area. All right. We want to get now to NBC 4's. Camilla Rambaldi. She is off of Télam and on airway Camilla. Michael and Colleen, the winds here have only intensified just in the last ten minutes. And now another fire truck here is coming up on the street, because now the focus is turning to what you see in the distance there. Those flames that have flared up just in the last five minutes. The visibility. It's very difficult to see right now. We can't tell if it's a hillside or if it's a home that is burning, but that just gives you an idea of just how quickly things can change here. Due to the severity of these gusty winds. And firefighters were just here on this street putting out this this house right here that went up in flames this afternoon that we watched burn. And the flames were so intense it almost they almost attacked the home next door. And luckily firefighters were able to spare that home. But that just gives you an idea of how quickly things can change here, just because of the intensity of the winds and those embers flying, and then thinking about just the amount of brush that is surrounding this area, making the firefighting efforts here very challenging. And firefighters have been here for the last several hours focusing on containment. They told me that they're also working on containing another fire that started just below this other home here on my right. So again, their focus is on, again, containment and making sure that these flames don't spread to other homes. But again, with the conditions and these winds that are only expected to get worse later tonight, it's very, very concerning. Colleen, Michael, you know, as we look at your picture there, it's hard to see the firefighters really seem to establish a defensive stand in this neighborhood. Can you give us an idea how close the flames are to this neighborhood? It's very difficult to tell. I would say it. We're downhill here. So there are a number of homes directly threatened by those flames up there. But it is because of the low visibility. It's very difficult to tell if that's a hillside or if it's a home that is burning right now. I asked earlier the firefighter if that's if they have several crews now that are going to be heading toward that direction. So we're going to continue to monitor the situation here and bring you another update. As soon as we learn more. But again, these winds are intensifying at this hour. You can just see those embers flying here on this street. Colleen and Michael. All right. Good to see that. At least firefighters are within that particular neighborhood. But we go from live shot to live shot. And it's the same scene, the same scenario, destruction. We see homes on fire. Let's get to NBC 4's. Tracey Leong. She is live along PCH near Will Rogers State Beach. Tracey. Wow. All right, Michael, you could just see how intense these winds are. My photographer, Sean Browning and I, at moments we feel these winds just blow us over as well. You can see the entire sky since we've last been on air with you. Completely dark. We've moved down just about a block. We're still at Will Rogers State Beach, but here along the bluffs you can see those flames, those glowing flames. Dozens of homes up on the hillside. You can see those trees just burning flames just shooting up from there. And that wind continuing to push these embers. We have seen embers after Ember fly across this area, and we're in the parking lot of the Will Rogers State Beach. But if you can see, I know it's really dark. There are several trees that have burned as well, and that's because those embers from these strong winds, they've been blown over. They've blown across PCH and we've seen trees just here at Will Rogers State Beach go up in flames. So that isust another huge concern. And what's scarier is we aren't even at the most intense part of these winds. It's going to get a lot worse. And the smoke, the visibility is extremely difficult to breathe to see. And we continue to see cars driving back and forth again. This is PCH for everyone who needs to evacuate. This is the main road that they need to use. These are the emergency crews that are driving here as well. And I'm sure you can hear that intense wind just fueling everything right now. But we're going to continue to monitor this. We have seen fire crews up in these hillsides. But right now Michael and Colleen, it looks like those homes might be a complete and total loss. That's the very latest out here. Back to you in the studio. Tracey. You say that you continue to see fire crews within the area. Any idea whether they're tending to what we're seeing up on that ridge there? You know, from my vantage point, Michael, it's difficult because we're near Tahiti Avenue and that road kind of bends around. So from where I'm standing, I can't see them. But I do see emergency crews going back and forth the hillside that I was at earlier. I did see some fire crews get in behind, but where we are, the roads that you would access, we can't see from where we're standing over by PCH. Tracey when we checked in with you last, there was a house that was catching fire. There were a couple people in the backyard. There were LAPD officers trying to evacuate them or encourage them to leave. Do we have any more on that story? Is there an update? So Colleen Sean is pointing his camera towards that area. So you see those flames, that home that we saw burning down probably about 50ft behind those orange flames that we see. We did see the entire house. It appeared to be burning and we actually had to leave that area calling because that thick black smoke, it was just filling that parking lot and we really couldn't breathe. It didn't feel that it was going to be safe there. We started to see embers flying in, and those are the palm trees we started to see just go up in flames. So that's why we moved. You know, I tried talking to the officers when they came down. I tried to get confirmation. We still don't know if anyone was inside if they were rescued. But we did see that home appear to burn down. And we left there just shortly after Tracey before we let you go here. And we appreciate this. How has the situation changed here over the course of the last 30 minutes? Has it become more intense, more aggressive? Yeah, it's become more aggressive. It's become more intense. You know, what's difficult is this smoke. I mean, when we first arrived, it was difficult to see. The sky was gray. It was smoky, but now it's completely black. You can't even see. You can barely see. Maybe 30ft ahead of you. So that's a big concern. If you're driving here and you need to get out. Sean's showing you the beach right now. The beach completely covered with smoke. You can see those embers continue to fly. It looks like they're landing on the sand right now. But these winds, they are so extreme, it's even difficult for me to stand and hold my ground because they just come and they kind of. They're really intense. As soon as they they hit you, it's almost like a force that you just got to hold yourself up. But it only seems to be getting a lot more aggressive as the time goes on. Michael and Colleen, we definitely see that. Tracey. And I want to remind people as we look at you, you're in a parking lot here. That area behind you where we see all those cars racing by that is PCH, Pacific Coast Highway that is closed all the way from roughly the tunnel or Lincoln all the way to Topanga Canyon. What you're seeing in the back, there are people evacuating and first responders. And obviously you see a lot of them with lights and sirens going. All right. Tracey appreciate it. Thank you. It's 530 and we are continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. We have been on the air bringing you live team coverage now for well over six hours. This fire exploding in size since this morning, about 1030, currently burning more than 1200 acres. We expect that number will grow. This is in the Pacific Palisades area. It's prompting closures, evacuations. More than 30,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Yeah. The winds. And you've obviously heard them in our reporter's live reports only expected to worsen here tonight. More than 10,000 homes have threatened, and we have already seen dozens of homes destroyed. As you've seen our team of reporters spread out across the area, giving you the most updated information. We're going to check in right now, though, with meteorologist David Biggar, who is tracking the peak of these winds, and David, that's yet to come. Exactly, Colleen. We likely have to wait until we get closer to 10:00 this evening before you start to see the winds pick up again. I mean, they're already starting to pick up now, but that peak of the wind will probably be somewhere between 10:00 this evening and 5:00 in the morning for tomorrow, depending on location. I wanted to quickly show you what this looks like from space. This is actually a satellite view of what we call fire temperature. So the brighter that these pixels are, the more intense the fire is burning. And the important thing that we've noticed out of this is that the area has been slowly expanding. We've obviously been keeping track of that with all of our reporters out in the field today, just how quickly this fire has spread. But also it is still very bright, as seen from satellite hundreds of miles up. It is still very intense out there currently, and this is likely going to get a little bit worse as the winds start really ramping up. So here's a look at the current wind conditions out there right now. I want to split kind of the two observation sites here. So we've got Topanga Beach and Pacific Palisades. Both these observation sites a little bit lower in elevation. More kind of what you would expect around the areas closer to Pacific Palisades and Topanga Beach. Obviously down by the beach. In fact, this observation site is right on the other side of PCH from the beach itself. You can see that both spots are reporting winds at about 10 to 15 miles an hour, although it's been a little bit variable here. It's kind of switching directions around. But we've been seeing gusts about 20 to 30 miles an hour. But as you get higher and higher up in elevation, as you get closer to the ridgelines, you start to see some more impressive gusts. For example, here's Santa Monica mountains. It's an observation site that is on one of the ridge tops right now, 34 mile per hour sustained winds, but we have gusts to 53 miles an hour right now. The other thing you'll notice on here is that the humidities are still very low out there. We're looking at humidity down around 12% for Topanga Beach. But for the other observation sites, reporting about 20 to 25% humidity. So let's talk a little bit about what the next couple of hours are going to look like. So for Pacific Palisades itself, we're just going to focus initially. And then I'll take you through parts of Ventura County and L.A. County. We're looking at the wind gusts remaining in about this 35 to 40 mile per hour range for at least the next few hours. But then as we get closer and closer to midnight again, that ten a 10 p.m. Start time about, we start to see the wind gusts intensity really ramp up. Now this is just a sampling of the gusts, meaning that we could potentially have gusts higher than 50 miles an hour, but probably in about that 45 to 55 mile per hour range. And that will be very brief. And then the intensity will come down as we go through the morning. But notice that all the way through 6 a.m, the gusts are still around 30 miles an hour or stronger. So even if we just get a very brief pulse of wind tonight, which it doesn't look like it's going to play out, it looks like we're going to have several hours of this. We would still have a lot of wind coming our way for tomorrow morning. Let's talk a little bit about some of the winds around the area right now. Then I'll get into the futurecast. You can see the. Currently Van Nuys is gusting up to about 32 miles an hour. But if you look toward the eastern portions of the San Fernando Valley closer to Burbank and the Verdugo Mountains, you've got this purple coloring here and even this little bit of a pink shading. That's wind gusts on our scale, 40 to 50 miles an hour, a little bit stronger. So we're starting to see some of that around the eastern San Fernando Valley. For portions of Santa Clarita, we're looking at gusts about 50 miles an hour. IE wind tunnel south of the Cone Pass. Very windy right now. We've got some gusts above 40 miles an hour and Orange County now also starting to see some of these impressive gusts with 46 mile per hour wind gusts being reported in Santa Ana. And look at LAX 41 mile per hour gusts. And that's typically a spot that's pretty wind sheltered during Santa Ana winds. So this is definitely a bit of a different kind of wind storm than we're used to with our Santa Ana winds. So here's what it looks like by 9:00 this evening. So we've got Ventura County on here and the San Fernando Valley over here. You'll notice that we've already got some pretty impressive winds around Porter Ranch. Wind gusts above 40 miles an hour. Look at Malibu. Look at Topanga Beach, also looking at wind gusts above 40 miles an hour. As we get closer and closer to midnight, though, look at the gusts intensity ramping up. This is what we've been very concerned about because you can see, especially as you look toward Burbank, 61 mile per hour gusts. We're starting to ramp the gusts into the damaging wind territory. This is where we start taking trees down in places. In some cases, you can start taking fences down if they're kind of weakly built. But essentially this is where we're concerned that we're going to start losing a lot of trees tonight. We're probably gonna have a bunch of power outages. And again, look at the timing. This is 11:00 this evening. So a lot of folks will probably be in bed and then suddenly have the power go out. But you'll be hearing this wind all the way through the morning. This is 7 a.m. Look at some of these wind gusts along the coastline above 50 miles an hour. We're still seeing some very strong gusts around Camarillo. Still seeing some impressive gusts around the San Fernando Valley as well. And it's not just the San Fernando Valley, it's also the San Gabriel Valley that we're keeping track of essentially anywhere that's got a mountain range or a set of hills, the south side of it. Looking at some impressive gusts tonight. In fact, here's what it looks like by 10 p.m. Look at Pasadena and Duarte, as well as Glendora, 50 to 60 mile per hour gusts. And again, that's the kind of wind speed we need to start seeing trees come down. So we're obviously concerned not just for the fire area but for a good portion of the region tonight, guys, just because of how strong the winds are going to be. And again, that time frame, it's probably around 10:00 this evening through about 4 or 5 a.m. Tomorrow morning. All right, David, thank you for that. Darsha Philips is standing by live right now. Apparently she's near Palisades Charter High School. Darsha. We understand there might be fire on the property there. Yeah. Colleen fire is surrounding the high school here, and we have seen some athletic buildings that are on fire. I haven't seen any of the main buildings on fire. But take a look at the pool right here. It is just covered with ash and smoke. The water pretty much black at this hour. You also hear those fire alarms going off. And again, we did witness some several athletic buildings on the baseball field go up in flames. Really sad for the kids that go to this school to see this happening right here. Now I do want to show you what's going on just across the street. This is Temescal Canyon. Lots of homes have burned. Also looks like another business or possibly a assisted care facility that's also on fire here. But this is these winds. Take a look at this. You can hear it. And you see those embers, how much they are able to just kind of go with the wind. And that's why this fire is moving so quickly. You saw several first responders going down Temescal Canyon Boulevard. We've also seen so many of them surrounding the high school here. When we first got here about 2.5 hours ago, this was the main concern. We saw a lot of first responders heading to the high school to try to do structure protection. But Colleen, I have covered a lot of fires. These winds are extreme. They are like none I have ever felt before. My photographer, my photographer and I are having a hard time staying put when some of these gusts come through, and you can see just how fast they're moving through this area, they're burning through homes. This home really just completely gone. You see the chimney there, but you don't. You barely see the structure at all. And this is on the other side of Radcliffe, where we were where at least 6 to 8 homes had burned. So this is how quickly this fire is moving. And again, you can see the dark black smoke here on Temescal Canyon Road. Here we see a lot of this home right here about to go up in flames. We see this fire. It looks like it's at the top floor, possibly in the attic. And that house is going to go as well. This has been really tragic to see so many homes go up so quickly. And also, what I do want to mention is when we've covered other fires, we have seen first responders at least try to do structure protection, try to save at least a portion of these homes. But this fire is moving so quickly that these first responders are having to try and get ahead of it, try to save as many homes as possible. And of course, their main priority right now is getting everyone out here. Now, we have seen people evacuated, but we have also seen several people still here in these neighborhoods. Such a dangerous situation. We just saw two people in their cars racing away. When you are told to evacuate, when you start seeing the sky, fill with smoke like we were reporting all yesterday, you do not have to wait for someone to tell you to evacuate. When you see the smoke and you see this fire, you need to get out of here. So you know they are trying to make sure that everyone is out of these neighborhoods safely. But unfortunately, Colleen Michael, we are seeing are some people who have stayed behind and now are racing to get out of these neighborhoods. Here's another first responder coming down Temescal Canyon again, trying to get into these neighborhoods to make sure everyone is okay and everyone is out. But again, these are conditions unlike I've ever experienced before with these winds. How strong they are. You can hear it whipping through my microphone. You can see how difficult it is for us to stand here, because when these winds gusts come through, it is so intense. And when it hits that fire and that flame, it is like a blowtorch. Colleen. We'll send it back to you. You know, before you go, very quickly. Darsha. Are you still with us? Mike and I were talking about this earlier. The water supply out there. When you talk about all of the Palisades has been evacuated and all the firefighters out there, when you look back and see how they're trying to protect this school, does there appear to be a problem with water supply at all? You know, that is a really great question. We are not hearing or seeing any water drops, which is another thing that you would think that we are seeing. And we actually haven't seen firefighters putting trying to douse the area with water. And I do not know what the water supply situation is at this time, but we do know when this was happening. Actually, we're going to come over this way. We do see some firefighters working over here at Pali High School. I think, trying to figure out exactly what is going on. Oh, it looks like something has caught fire. But again, this the situation is so extreme when it comes to trying to get ahead of these things. And honestly, Colleen, I don't know if they were able to put something out. Oh, it looks like a building. You see that building right over there? This is the Pali High School, Pali Charter High School property. And we do see what appears to be a building on fire. Really tragic here. But again, take a look at these conditions. This would be so difficult for them to even put water on this, because the wind is blowing so hard. So right now, I think that they're just trying to make sure that everyone is okay and protect what they can when it comes to structures, and make sure that they themselves are okay. It's a very difficult, very dynamic situation out here. Colleen. Again, unlike that we've ever experienced before. All right. Darsha Philips there live near Palisades Charter High School. I checked their website earlier today. They continue their winter break this week, so at least some good news there for them. But obviously returning back to school next week with some damage to assess. Sadly, they will be going in to see at least one or more of their buildings damage. You are right about that. All right, we want to get to NBC 4's Robert Kovacik, who is live there at Palisades and Sunset Forest. Robert, while active flame behind you, there. Well, you know what? This is what's interesting. And also terrifying. We are on sunset. We were talking about the flames that were pushing towards the ocean. This is now pushing east. We are on Sunset Boulevard and you can see that the wind has shifted direction, at least for this moment. And here in right before, as the sun started to set, you really felt the winds pick up and you can see that they are really pushing. Now look at that. Pushing east on sunset, a road that is completely closed off. And if you think this fire hasn't spread Scott, just turn around right here. This is right out outside of the fellowship of realization, the fire now burning on this side of sunset again, everywhere you turn, you see some type of flames. You see some type of activity. But just when you start to think the fire is heading in one direction, it is now pushing in another direction. So we have seen fire crews now begin to turn and leave sunset pushing west and now sunset heading east. Because again, you just don't know where this fire is going next. And be very careful, Scott, as you stand here, this as you see, probably a car looking to get out of the way, because just when you think that you're going to be out, you know, out of harm's way, you suddenly you see the fire has shifted direction. And look at the look at the winds, how it is pushing these flames right here. You can feel it. And this is one of those gusts that Melissa and David and everyone has been talking about that we are expecting. These are the gusts. And look right now just embers flying now up Sunset Boulevard heading away. Their structures right there on top. There are other ways. There are other homes right here that are threatened. I don't even know what is on fire. Right over across here on sunset. But another building, another home is definitely burning here. And this is that's Palisades pushing towards the ocean. But the but the wind has definitely picked up the wind, at least right now, has definitely shifted direction. And we're going to just take a little walk here on sunset. Basically coming down Sunset Boulevard from the Palisades Village, heading towards Highlands, you are going to see pockets of fire on both sides of the street. And these are the embers that you fear. These are the embers one can travel miles and one can light a home on fire. Light a structure on fire, fire burning on both sides of the road. Here the wind is picking up and the firefight again. You have to pick and choose where you're going to go. If you are these firefighters as well as members of the LA of the LAPD that have had to also decide where they're going to help people evacuate. They were stationed at Palisades and Highlands, which we're going to show you. But again, this is now we are about eight hours since this happened, and it is worth looking at again, because this sort of defines exactly what this firefight has been looked like all day. And as you mentioned, Colleen, you don't like to use the word explode. We don't use it lightly. But this is a fire that exploded. These are the fire. These are the cars still here that were abandoned because people feared the fire was coming too close. And these are the cars that now were severely damaged by the bulldozer that had no choice but to come out, come over here and clear them out of the way so they can continue this firefight. A firefight right now that is traveling in so many directions. And just like these cars here again, we are so far from figuring out where we need to go, what direction we need to go, and where we need to end up when it comes to trying to get a handle on this fire containment, I will tell you, must be next to impossible because there's no possible way to even see a containment line there. You see, this is the intersection of highlands and sunset. That is the fire that continues to burn here. Where we saw you last time. We saw that apartment complex. It is right below those flames. An apartment complex once again, that just stands in harm's way. Like so many structures here on the west side of Los Angeles. Let's go back to you. All right, Robert. Thank you. Robert mentioned containment. You can't even figure out what the leading edge is on that fire. And sunset almost looked like it had molten lava rolling down it. Our Karma Dickerson is live now. She's moved. She's along Vista Grande Drive. At this point. Karma. Just a few minutes from where we were coming to you from before. Colleen. And this is a really important place we're coming to you from, because it gives you an idea of the big picture. As we've seen fire after fire, spot after spot, hillside after hillside, it's hard to get an idea of the breadth of the destruction and the threat here. We want to give you a look at this view and that really helps put it in perspective. We're taking a look down from Vista Grande Drive to Enchanted Way, where the neighbor here tells us that the fire has been burning largely unchecked all day. He's looking at homes he's looked at since his childhood. This is his childhood home, and he's watching them burn below. And so to understand a little bit more about what we're taking a look at and how this all unfolded today, I want to introduce you to Brandon. Thank you so much. I know you grew up here. Your parents still live here, and you guys were here as it unfolded today. Yeah, we were coming home early this morning and we first saw the smoke off PCH. And then by the time we were coming up the hill, there was large flames up above Temescal. And I'd say within probably an hour and a half, this hillside right below our house and our neighbor's house were on fire. Okay, so let's take a look at this hillside as you're explaining to us about what exactly you found. For example, the house just below you burned. Yeah, it's completely gone. It's an older house. It's got a lot of wooden eaves, and the decks caught fire. It's vacant. We tried to put out some spot fires, but there really wasn't anything we could do in the darkness and the smoke, we can only really see the glow of the flames below. What have you been looking at all day in terms of what has burned over there? Well, like you said, in a way I've seen from the top all the way down. Now, there's probably 8 or 10 homes. I don't know the exact number. That's my guesstimate that are on fire. You can see Paseo Miramar over there. I'd say there's at least 6 or 8 homes there. And then Highlands, the Palisades Highlands going up Palisades Drive, both sides of the canyon are on fire to help orient people. You're telling us the ocean is this way? It's over to the right hand side of the screen, correct? Yeah. This is all Santa Monica Bay. Excuse me. So. And so, what are these last few hours been like for you? I understand you were fighting for the home yourself. Yeah. The last few hours have been pretty mellow. This morning was very hectic, but luckily an engine pulled up just in the nick of time and pulled hoses around the house, and we were able to kind of keep things safe for us. So that was amazing. Engine 98, LA Fire Department from Pacoima. Thank you guys. Fantastic. But as we're standing here and we can barely keep our feet rooted because of this heavy wind, the way it's whipping, what is the rest of the night look like for you? Well, it looks like the water just went out, so I was planning on just working embers and spot fires. At this point, I guess I'll have to find a shovel. The engines are gone. The winds are picking up. Luckily, most of the fuel around our house is already burned, so I'm just hoping for a miracle. Your parents did safely make it out, though, correct? Yeah, we got them out with the dogs early, and so they're fine. They're at my brother's house. Lastly, if things take a turn, do you have a plan? What are you going to do? Do you have a backup for if things start to get out of control for you? Yeah, just get out. I've got my car in the driveway ready to go. Hopefully it won't come to that, but we'll see. Yeah. Thank you so much, Brant. Good luck to you tonight. Thank you for allowing us back here to your home in this very difficult time. Guys, you could probably hear how the wind is picking up. It's hard to even stay on our feet at this point. And so you can see what firefighters are up against as they are trying to battle the flames in a pretty chaotic situation. How do you even begin to get a handle on flames when they are whipping around you at every step? So again, a reminder that we're not just dealing with the fire here, but that significant wind warning wind threat, even if you're not in the fire zone, be careful as you're out there. Things are falling from the skies. Things are whipping around lawn furniture, plants, everything. So hopefully people are being safe and taking precautions. But that is the latest from here in the Palisades. I'll send it back to you. Karma did he mention there's a problem with water in the neighborhood? Can you repeat that? I said, did he just mentioned there's a problem with water in the neighborhood? Water? Can you hear me? Yes, I did water in the neighborhood. We were at a previous location on Lockman and the house that we showed you that had been burning for several hours. We saw firefighters pulling up their hoses. They said that they had lost their water supply there, and it was unclear whether or not the fire hydrant was out of water or if it had just malfunctioned. But they mentioned that they were trying to find another way to get water to that section of the street. We moved over here and we just heard from from Brant that they had turned off the water for the utilities. And so that I'm not sure if that is to preserve it for firefighters so they have more access and higher water pressure, or if there's something else going on, we're definitely going to look into that and find out what's going on there. But as a resident, his water has been turned off here on on this particular street, Vista Grande. All right. Karma Dickerson there live for us. We want to now bring in NBC 4's Camilla Rambaldi. She is located there off of Tellem and Don airway. Camilla. Hi, Michael. Since I last spoke to you, we were talking about those additional flames that erupted up this hill. And now the focus for firefighters is right here behind me. This hillside now on fire. You can see those embers flying in the air. And just the intense smoke. And now fire crews are having to come through. So we're actually moving. But you just can see just how much this has intensified because of these winds. And again, fire crews now putting their focus up on this hill, it is very difficult to see if there are a number of homes up there. From our vantage point. But you can see those trees on fire, that smoke billowing into the air. And just how quickly these flames can spread because of these intense winds that are only expected to intensify tonight. So this has been this has made a very this has been such a challenge for firefighters to contain this. And that has been their focus for the last few hours that we've been here. And I also would like to mention that home that that we saw burning this. Afternoon earlier about 15, 20 minutes ago, those flames flared up again. So fire crews were focused on putting out those hotspots and that containment. So just another example of just how these winds are playing such a role in these embers just flying everywhere and potentially sparking other fires. Michael. All right. Camilla Rambaldi live there for us off and on air. And we want to bring in now. Meteorologist Melissa Magee Melissa. We heard it from Robert. We heard it from Tracey. Again, the shift in these winds right. When you think they're heading this way, they're tricky. They headed somewhere else. Yeah that's right. And they're getting stronger Michael and Colleen. And it's just hard to believe some of the images we're seeing from our reporters there on the ground. I mean, it's unreal. It looks unbelievable. Almost looked like scenes from movies. But unfortunately this is real life and this is really impacting a lot of families, a lot of homes, a lot of communities in and around that area. So as we go throughout the rest of tonight, it's only going to get stronger in terms of the winds. Latest observation data showing you where the fire originally was sourced and the location of that fire close to the Palisades. But now, looking at the images, you can see it's not just this location. We're putting out hotspots in these communities. So we've got winds sustained at 16mph for the Palisades, gusting up to 36mph. Topanga Beach, we've got a gust up to 32mph. And then you move over out across areas in the Santa Monica mountains. We've got winds gusting as high as 56mph, and the relative humidity is starting to lower as well as we go throughout the rest of tonight, it's going to be an issue in terms of the smoke, the ash, the particulate matter in the atmosphere. So there's a wildfire smoke advisory in effect, Santa Monica over into Calabasas, also as far west as Malibu. As we go throughout the rest of tonight. What started this, what created these Santa Ana winds here in Southern California? Let's show you what's going on in the atmosphere in terms of what we're dealing with here. We have this ridge of high pressure out in the Pacific, this area of low pressure out across the Great Basin. And that just dropped in just to the north of Southern California. And the pressure gradient in between these two systems helps to funnel in all of that wind energy down to the surface. And that wind energy is warming. It's compressing and it's drying things out. So this was the example I was using. If you're in between this tight pressure gradient here, that's you walking through two buildings on each side of you. And that wind really rushes in. A pretty good example of visual of what you see on the ground happening up in the upper levels of the atmosphere here as we go throughout time. I want to show you the current wind gusts across the region, gusting up to 52mph in Santa Clarita. We've got a gust in Santa Ana and Orange County up to 46mph, and we've got gusts there in Ontario, up to 44mph as well. Relative humidity will continue to lower into the lower teens because of that red flag warning that we do have, in effect, relative humidity down to 16% for the Basin, 14% in Van Nuys, Santa Clarita. We've got relative humidity down to 15%. It will continue to lower as we go throughout the rest of tonight. And the peak of the winds later tonight in about four hours time from now. So from 10 p.m, even as we go throughout the overnight hours until 5 p.m. 5 a.m, I should say on Wednesday. Very interesting. As we're watching the images here on your screen, is that the sun is setting, and we did have some aerial assaults with in terms of getting the upper hand on the fire there in the Palisades fire. But I'm curious to know if this will likely be more of a ground attack because we are losing some of that light from the day. So we're watching the fire very closely, and the conditions that will only strengthen as we go throughout the rest of tonight. Colleen and Michael, I want to send it back over to you, Melissa. When we look at the pictures that we've seen, especially this picture, I believe it's from LAX pointed towards the Palisades. There's only one phrase that comes to mind, and that is. Fire, storm. Oh, I mean, it's incredible. Colleen, the images that we're seeing, it's you. It's hard to believe that this is happening where we live. And it's hard to believe that it intensified so quickly in so many areas. So it's not just a matter of maintaining and managing containment in one specific area. I mean, like Robert was saying, Darsha was saying, Karma was saying, where do you go? Where do you go with a significant wind event that's moving into our area? Where do you go in the sense that where do you battle the fire next, right, to get the upper hand, because these embers are flying so far in advance of where the fire originated, and now you're dealing with a situation where you've got hotspots and unburned fuel in between those hotspots. It's incredible. As we're watching the images in the terms that this is dangerous, this is destructive, and this is a significant Santa Ana wind event that we should not take lightly. So this will likely be something that we can move forward with as we watch for what's to come. As we get into tonight and into Wednesday, and ways in which we should prepare. All right. So you talk about preparation, but again, the strongest of these winds happen. What Melissa between what, nine and 10:00 and beyond tonight. Yeah, I would say so between 10 p.m. Tonight Michael. Right through the overnight hours. While a lot of us are sleeping. So this is when you want to prepare. And then 5:00 in the morning. Still we're dealing with the height of those winds that are currently moving here in Southern California. Then after that they will start to ease. But don't let your guard down. It's still something that we have to watch very closely because now we're drying out the atmosphere with that northeasterly wind coming through the mountains and canyons, drying everything out as it races down to the south and west. Seeing the issue that we see on your screen there, I suspect a lot of people will not be sleeping tonight in Southern California. It's difficult. Melissa. Thank you. It's just about 6:00 right now. We are continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Good evening once again, everyone. I'm Colleen Williams and I'm Michael Brownlee. Thank you so much for sticking with us. We have been on the air bringing you live team coverage now for about seven hours. This is not a drill. This is an actual public safety emergency. Thousands of residents forced to evacuate as flames from a fire in Pacific Palisades destroys homes. The smoke is getting thick very quickly. By the time it was time for us to go in the chaos of trying to escape, some people even had to abandon their cars. Firefighters are trying to get a handle on the flames, but the fight is far from over. We're not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination. NBC 4 news at six starts with breaking news. Let's get to it now. The fire now currently burning more than 1200 acres here in the Pacific Palisades area, prompting closures and evacuations. This fire is exploding in size since this morning, more than 30,000 people have been forced to evacuate. Governor Newsom has officially declared a state of emergency for the Palisades Fire. Those winds only expected to worsen, as we've heard from our meteorologist tonight, with more than 10,000 homes threatened. We continue our live team coverage here at six First Alert. Meteorologist Melissa Magee and David Biggar are standing by to talk about what we can expect heading into tonight. But we begin with Alex Rozier there on El Oro and Enchanted Way. Alex. Yeah, we've been out here for the last 20 minutes, and you can take a live look behind us and see the flames that are taking over several homes here. We were on the air at five, about a half mile away on Télam, and the firefighters were taking off. I said, where are you going? They said, there are six homes on fire on Enchanted Way. Follow us and you can see what we're looking at right now. And frankly, this is just the start of it. As I've mentioned throughout the day, the cell phone signal is not as strong here. So we aren't able to show you around the corner. But I can tell you that the LA City Fire Department has several trucks up Enchanted Way, just down from El Oro, and there are several homes that are currently engulfed in flames. And frankly, these homes aren't the first ones to go up on this road. Today, I want to show you the video that I shot a couple hours ago on this same road we were driving down, and at that point, there were only a few that had caughtire. And sadly, any is too much. But it was a couple and now it's far more than that. So the LA City Fire fighters are actively working to put this out. Right now. We have not seen any neighbors in this neighborhood, thank goodness. But we do see a couple of cars pass us now. But no one appears to be. Everyone seems to have heeded the evacuation orders and taken off. Only the firefighters remain. But as you look live here tonight, this is certainly a point of focus for these crews. The wind has intensified as we said it would. The gusts are strong and the embers you can see flying into the night sky. So it's a dangerous, ongoing story. And enchanted way seems to be particularly hit hard by the Palisades fire that continues right now. Michael and Colleen, we'll send it back in to you. All right, Alex, thank you. In case you're wondering, we've been talking about how you can see this fire from all over Southern California. This is a shot, a live picture right now from downtown LA. This is a camera pushed back and facing the Palisades area. But you can see it's really lighting up the sky out there. The flames. When I was driving in today, I said you could see it from Glendale the 134. You can see it pretty much everywhere. We had a shot there from Playa del Rey, and you could see it in the distance. So again, like you mentioned, there's not a spot here in Southern California where you can't see it, and tomorrow you'll be able to feel it with all the ash and the smoke and the embers in the air. Robert Kovacik has been on Sunset Boulevard, very close to the area where they pushed all those cars out of the way with a bulldozer. Today, Robert is apparently driving right now and is about to show us some more of what's going on in the Palisades area. Robert. So Colleen and Michael, I'm just going to break for a second so you can see and you can hear the wind. But what we are doing right now is that our veteran photographer, David Gregory, just called me and said, you got to get down here. There's a mobile home park on fire. So photographer Scott Weber and I, Scott in the passenger seat, I'm going to do the driving, are going to try to get there. And we are with you right now. You can see, first of all, this is a tree that is down tree that is also on fire here on sunset. Okay. For those of you who live in this area, this is Paseo Miramar that we are passing. This is a fire station where we see firefighters right here. Now, just a short distance away. We've got firefighters, we've got fire on both sides, got a unit coming up. So we're going to pull to the side okay. But now you see here you hear the wind. Right. You see what's coming down now. And you see that the fire has jumped. So the fire has jumped. Sunset. This is just incredible. The fact that this fire hopscotches and spreads one side right here. And then look over here, I'm going to roll down this window and I'm going to be very careful because this was an explosion we heard before. You see those cars on fire here, if you live in this area and you know what structure that is, you can please let us know. But whatever it is, you see that these cars, these these it looks like some type of facility here. It is definitely not a residence. But there are there are apartments above it. Look at that right there. Just burning. Just burning. No firefighters here. Colleen and Michael. Nothing here to stop this fire. Nothing here to stop those embers at all that you see here that are burning. And so we are going to continue this drive, and we are just a short distance away from where we need to go. So stay with us. Still on sunset, pitch black lights are out. Can't see anything now. David Gregory tells me. So here I am, I'm at PCH and sunset famous intersection here. David Gregory tells me to take a left here. Okay, I'm taking a left. It is so dark. You hit the beams again. See if that helps. So this is sunset right here. I mean this is PCH that we're on right here. David Gregory has told us our photographer, we are looking for a mobile home park that is on fire. So as we move up PCH, PCH, heading towards Santa Monica, you can see the flames here. Another firefight that has to go underway or another fire that they cannot do anything about because you just again don't know where to turn. It's very hard with winds that are so strong to even try and throw water on it. You don't see, you know, the aerial fight that you can because of these winds. Okay, so gang, you're in the same boat I am, I do not know where I am going here in terms of where I am looking, but this is the drive here and I believe we may be getting close, but this is where we are heading here. And David Gregory telling me that a mobile home park is on fire. And unfortunately, I believe we have arrived and you see it right here. And it is it is just another shocking sight and it's another sight of someone's dreams that have disappeared. And you just pray that there is just buildings that are lost in what is left here. According to what you are looking at right here. Scott, let's hop out as carefully as we can, as we are on PCH. I will do our homework in terms of what this is, guys, and what what exactly we is, what we are looking at. But it it's right here on PCH. This was, we believe to be a mobile home park and a mobile home park that is no longer. And the we see the, the explosions here from inside. And you feel it, you feel the flames. They are roaring and these are flames right now that fortunately, if they cross PCH there's just nothing but ocean to greet them. Just going to be quiet. Do you hear that? Do you hear those explosions? So that's what we are looking at right now. So what we have done is we've just driven a short distance down sunset watch fire, burning things, burning structures burning. And once again, another structure is burning as an evacuation warning comes into place that has been issued for Malibu, west of Las Flores Canyon Road. And here we are right here. The fire here on PCH burning and has taken out what appears to be this mobile home park. I would think some of those explosions. Michael Robert might be propane tanks. They're just thinking the same thing. Yeah. Can I get your feed? Yeah, just look at it. Just. It is roaring and. And when we heard from our photographer that the mobile home park was on fire, it had just started. This was. This didn't take long for this fire to spread. How it got here. Colleen and Michael, why this mobile home park? Why this structure? When you look around here, you don't see anything else really on fire on these hillsides. But again, what is on the other side of PCH, fortunately, is a parking lot and there is just nothing but ocean there. So if that fire is being pushed toward the water, it's exactly where we want it to go. But but look at that. And again. And we now see cars here on PCH. Lots of emergency vehicles, but lots of people who realize that this no longer is a safe place for them, where it is safe in West Los Angeles right now, I honestly don't know, because everywhere we have gone, it looks very, very dangerous and we have seen fires everywhere. We have looked on both sides of sunset and the surrounding areas. Robert, are you still in the Palisades or are you in Santa Monica now? I you know what I would guess, and I'm sure because our viewers are really helpful knowing that I'm not great with my navigation to tell me where I am. But I know that we have gone PCH at sunset and we have made a left. And so yeah, we are definitely heading towards in Santa Monica. You hear that? What is that? What is that? Something? And. Scott smart, smart man. Let's move back. So yeah. So we so yes, to answer your question, we are we are pushing towards Santa Monica right now. And again this is what we showed you a short time earlier you guys is that we saw it. We thought the fire was pushing a bit west, but it keeps pushing east. Now the wind direction at least now has seemed to seem to change. And up and down. Scott, just give me a quick little pan here. You can see. So this is Pacific Coast Highway. East, heading east of sunset. And you can see the flames are just from the embers have started fires, you know, along this area just just picking different places to go. And then, you know, it finds a spot like that mobile home park where there is plenty to burn and it just latches on and it just chews through it and wow, this, this went really, really quickly. All right. So Robert Kovacik there for us as we watch a mobile home park go up in flames. We've heard what appeared to be some explosions as well. We want to bring in our fire expert now, Chief Sam DiGiovanna. Chief Sam, you know, Robert talked about how there was nothing else within this area that was on fire besides this mobile home park. Again, a testament to the power of those winds and those embers. Yeah. All it takes is an ember. It could be one mile, two miles, three miles away. It could hit one mobile home. And with this wind, those other mobile homes become the fuel. And it could take out the whole mobile home park. We talked about with Robert and some of our other reporters. They're out fanned out across the Palisades area about the wind direction shifts that they've witnessed and seen. How difficult does this make this for the firefight? Overall, this is very difficult for firefighters because this is very erratic winds which result in erratic fire behavior. And we're seeing this. But Michael Colleen, I do want to say something. You know, we've been covering this most of the day. We talked how fortunate we are that this was the only fire burning. Well, that's not the case now, I've watched several other fires starting to pop up through the Southland. The worst is yet to come with the winds. And as I said before, homeowners in the hillside areas start being prepared to evacuate because I have a feeling we're going to see a lot more fires before the night's over with chief Sam, talk to us a little bit about the spotting we're seeing here. You know, typically when you cover fires or firestorms or wildfires, there's a leading edge of the fire. There's a flank of the fire. We don't seem to be able to get a handle on this at all. Is that the same problem that firefighters are facing? Yes. They are exactly facing that Colleen, because this is very erratic. Embers are blowing everywhere. They're igniting homes and then homes start catching other homes on fire. Other hillsides catch on fire. You got topography driven fires. You know, it's pretty very intense right now. Putting it lightly. And like I said, the worst is yet to come. All right. Chief Sam DiGiovanna, our fire expert here at NBC 4. If you can hold tight here for us, we want to get to Zoe Navarro from our sister station, Telemundo 52. She is alive. She is live along, I should say. I believe it's Temescal Canyon Road. Zoe, can you hear us? Yes. Hello. How are you guys? Well, the conditions here are very, very dangerous. The. The wind is very strong as as you can see, this is a building. This was a designer nursery. Everything is burned right now. As you can see, this is completely destroyed. It's devastating how this wind just can blow out everything. As you can see, it's very dangerous that embers that that sparkles. Are burned everywhere. And they're blowing out. We're trying to show you actually thi. This was a tree of avocados. All the avocados are all on the streets burned. This place was very big. We, as we're trying to get more. Near to the place to show you how is this, this fire? For now, we're saw some crews to try to see if there is going to cross to another street, another house, another structure, and definitely this wind are too strong and they're trying to see if there can control it. But for now it's. It is impossible. We are exactly at the intersection of Thomas Cal Canyon and the. Bolton Street. This is a very busy street. A lot of crews are passing by. I think this is one of the places most important to try to get into the houses. He's just in front of the. I didn't see. Its Palisades Charter High School. It's just in front. Actually, this building, it's a burning too. Right now. There. If we can. Julia, show us this is the high school and we can see some embers up there and the other side and some houses burned completely at the at the hill, you can see some of. Orange color. That doesn't mean that everything is burned over there. The embers, it's all over the place. And some people trying to get out to here leaving their cars, leaving their belongings behind because it's very, very dangerous area. For now, this is what we have. It's a it's a crazy. It's crazy here. And it's very dangerous. We're trying to get to you. All the images that we can to the, to the people can see how it this this is not a joke. You can have to be very, very careful with this situation because this is going to be worse in the latest hours. You're right about that. Zoe Navarro, thank you so much. Those pictures, David Biggar we look at them right now and you can see the embers flying around, and it looks like the wind is picking up out ther. And, I mean, it really is something to see when you think about the embers and it makes you understand the spotting and how this fire is spreading and traveling so quickly. I'm absolutely stunned by Zoe's images there. You saw as all those embers came down the street, none of them went out. They were all staying bright orange all the way across the street. They came hundreds of feet and never really went out. And all it takes is one of those hitting some dry grass, and you've got another spot fire. And you are seeing that in that image there, that there were hundreds of them coming down the street. And that's just one area. There are multiple areas of this, this Colleen and Michael, this is starting to remind me a little bit of the 1991 Oakland Hills fire that was only about 1500 acres that destroyed 2000 structures because it burned house to house to house, and it was in a 60 mile per hour wind. And that was carrying embers everywhere and was making it very difficult for firefighters to keep up and kind of seeing a little bit of some parallels with what we're getting tonight. So here's what the current observations are looking like out there. We started to see the gusts pick up again across the Santa Monica mountains. Our ridge top gusts are now above 60 miles an hour, once again around Pacific Palisades, still gusting 20 miles an hour. However, look at the topography of this region. You see all of the mountains, all the little canyons and valleys here. We're getting a lot of channeling, and that can sometimes increase wind speeds. It'll switch directions around, makes it very difficult for firefighters to be fighting this. One additional note on this map, this red outline here. This is what the fire outline was a couple of hours ago. It has been updating so many times we can't even keep our map updated with this. So just keep in mind that was just a generalized area of where the fire is burning. It is definitely outside of that perimeter right now. But here's what we're looking at currently with the wind gusts as we go through the next couple of hours, a reminder we're looking at the strongest winds likely happening between about 10 p.m. Tonight and 4 or 5 a.m. Tomorrow. This is 9 p.m. This evening, and you can see what's about to happen. The San Gabriel Mountains now lit up with very strong gusts. This red coloring gusts above 60 miles an hour. That translates down into lower elevations as we get into the early morning. This is 1 a.m, San Fernando Valley, San Gabriel Valley, looking at gusts easily 40 to 50 miles an hour or even stronger. And we're seeing that also through some areas where the fire is burning on the south side of the Santa Monica mountains. So something we're still concerned about going through the next few hours. Back to you. All right, David, thank you for that. We want to now get to NBC 4 S Darsha Philips. She's near Theater Palisades over there on Temescal Canyon. Darsha. Yeah. Michael. Palisades theater completely burned out right now. We just saw a partial roof collapse of the building here on Temescal Canyon. Take a look at it. It is completely engulfed in flames. When we came by here just about 30 minutes ago, this was not on fire again. It gives you a really good idea of how quickly these flames are moving. We do see first responders and fire trucks trying to get up in here and put out some of these flames. I did speak to a firefighter asking about if they are trying to put water on any of these flames, and what he told me is that it is ineffective under these conditions. These winds are blowing so hard and so fast that putting water on these buildings will virtually do nothing. So right now they are in the watch. Wait and see. We do see some first responders running into the building over there to make sure that, you know, things are okay inside the theater. But again, the theater is completely engulfed. We are seeing some major fire. Fire conditions here. We have not had rain for several months. So all this vegetation, all of this brush around the Pacific Palisades area is just dry and kindling for fire. Again, we are starting to see some of that roof continue to collapse and more first responders coming to this area to try to make sure that this building doesn't take down power lines. Again, this is a collapse of a very large theater here. Palisades Theater. It is concerning for responders is why they are coming over this way. We are not far away from Palisades High School as well. We did drive by that area, and we did see several of the main buildings on fire at Palisades High School. What you're looking at actually is the high school. We're just across the street from it. So again, this is such a dynamic situation right now. I do again want to show you all the smoke and the flames that are pouring out of the theater at this moment. And right now, I think what fire crews are so concerned about are those big, tall trees, as well as those power lines. And we have a very tall building here, a very large roof that collapsed just moments ago. That brought a lot of those first responders here. But again, we're still feeling some very strong winds. And I know you guys mentioned it earlier, these winds keep shifting. They are not blowing in one direction for any amount of time. They continue to blow in all directions. They blow through this canyon and then they change, which is what is making this firefight so difficult. And really talking to that firefighter, it was so insightful because what they said is we are in the wait, watch and see right now, really getting ahead of this fire, trying to contain this fire is not something that they can do because of these conditions. Michael Colleen all right. Darsha, thank you for that. You can't help but notice that the winds are shifting every time we go to a reporter out there. But as you can see there, the Palisades Theater has been lost in all of this. NBC 4's Alex Rozier is standing by right now live for us on El Oro and Enchanted Wind. I just want to make note of the fact as well. There's been an update on the acreage. Alex. Over 2900 acres right now burned. Well and I'll tell you, we have talked all day about these winds and they are so strong, so intense right now. As these fire crews continue to battle this at at this moment, I want to step out of the way and show you the hillside behind me, because earlier we were at Enchanted Way and El Oro. We have come back to give you more of a perspective. We're at a cone and via Santa Ynez, there's a gentleman who lives right here, who is still here, who doesn't want to appear on camera. Understandably, with all that's going on. But he he will tell us a little bit more about what you've witnessed. You've been standing at your home here watching this fire grow. Yeah. It's a typical big fire that comes through brush that hasn't been, you know, exposed to fire in a long time. And a lot of these homes are, you know, in, in an important position. And unfortunately we're seeing a number of homes that are being susceptible to these flames. And a lot of it has to do with the brush on the hillsides. And it's really a shame. And you've been watching it for a good while here. I saw when the fire crews came up, you directed them to where the newest fire was located. What? How quick has it taken off? Well, it's been all day. I mean, it was it was probably about 1030 that it too. It started. It came down this way. You can see it pretty consistently, but we've been trying to help with the with the fire department to let them know where to go and how to get there, because we're not familiar. You know, you have wonderful firemen from all over the state that are coming in. And police officers, if they're not familiar with these Del Valle Park streets and this road that we're looking at right now has one way in, one way out, correct? Yeah, there's one way in and one way out. There is. Access way up off of enchanted Way to Lockman. But the people locked it off. Obviously, you've been listening to Alex Rozier out there, and we can barely understand him because the wind has picked up right now. We're going to bring in meteorologist Melissa Magee to talk about that a little bit. What are the gusts up to in that area right now? Melissa. Right now, Colleen, we've got winds gusting anywhere from 20mph to about 30mph, some stronger gusts as we move away from that region up across the mountain tops, the Santa Monica mountains, ranging anywhere from about 50 to 60mph. We've been talking about the peak intensity and when that will arrive. Let's talk about what's next, what's to come over the next 12 to 24 hours with this windstorm that we're tracking? Destructive Santa Ana winds will continue as we go throughout the overnight hours into our Wednesday. What specifically in terms of timing here, the strongest winds will likely be sometime around 10:00 tonight through the overnight hours into 5 a.m. On Wednesday. In terms of the impacts for our region, this is the problem. We're seeing it as we watch the live images come on through school closures, especially where we have evacuation orders in place because of the strong Santa Ana winds that are making the wind fire more damaging and more dangerous and destructive. Downed trees and power lines. Power outages is a big concern in terms of impacts and extremely critical fire weather, because the Santa Ana winds have the ability to carry the fire and the embers long distances. And when we're dealing with significant Santa Ana's like this, remember we're calling for gusts anywhere from 60 to 70mph for the coast and the valleys. We've already had that. Some spots have some spots have surpassed that. And then for the mountains gusts anywhere from 65 to 80mph. Plus, look at this. Currently in Van Nuys, we've got a wind gusting up to 52mph, gusting in Lancaster, up to 43 close to 50mph there in Santa Ana and Orange County. Some of the other wind reports we had earlier today, Fremont Canyon in Orange County, up to 80mph. Lytle Creek 70 61mph. Close to banning, close to Simi Valley 58mph in areas that are typically sheltered, like Los Angeles, you're still also seeing gusts pretty strong tonight up to 36mph. So let's take you into time in terms of tracking when those winds will arrive. I want to show you 10 p.m. Tonight when the peak intensity will start here in Southern California. Look at this. We've got winds gusting close to 36mph in Malibu. Also want you to focus in on the colors here on this map. Here, the light purple and the red and the white. That's winds gusting anywhere from 60 to 70 plus miles per hour. And it will only intensify during the overnight hours. So we're watching conditions here in Malibu 5:00 in the morning. Look at this. Up to 50mph. So those strong Santa Ana winds with that northeasterly flow comes off of the mountains, down through the canyons and passes, and it moves all the way down to the beach, all the way down to the coast. We're also seeing winds gusting close to 40mph in Hemet. So red flag warning stays up because as that Santa Ana wind moves on through it compresses, it warms, it dries us out at the surface. And as we're seeing with the images with the Palisades Fire, we've got extremely critical fire weather here in Southern California. And the worst is yet to come in terms of the significant winds that will be on the way. That's the very latest. We'll continue to monitor it throughout the night. Colleen. And now Kathy, I'll send it back over to you. That's right. Melissa joined by Kathy Vara. Right now it is 630. We are continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. We've been on the air bringing you live team coverage over 7.5 hours. At this point, we're expecting to be on the air throughout the night. NBC Nightly News is being preempted tonight because of the severity of what's going on in Southern California. This fire exploding in size, currently burning nearly 3000 acres in the Palisades area, prompting closures and evacuations. In fact, more than 30,000 people have been forced to evacuate. We can add to that. Governor Newsom has now declared a state of emergency. More than 10,000 homes are being threatened. We have seen dozens of homes already destroyed. It is really heartbreaking. Our team of reporters, they are out there. They are navigating the area as best they can. We want to bring you the very most up to date information to keep you safe. NBC 4's Alex Rozier is still on El Oro and Enchanted Way. Alex, you counted a number of homes that have been lost in this fire so far. Yeah, Colleen, we actually moved just down the road a little bit further to give you a bigger perspective of the hillside that has caught fire here. And I'll say right now it is so windy. The gusts are so strong and so intense. So I apologize if the audio is tough to make out, but you can see what it looks like from where we are at via Santa Ynez. And hearken, there are a number of hillsides or homes on this hillside that have caught fire. And I'll tell you that a large number of them, we're talking a handful more 5 to 10 homes that we could see are on fire on Enchanted Way near El Oro. We have moved down a little bit further away. As I mentioned in my last live report, this is a road that has mainly one way in and one way out. We did speak to one person who owns a home right here. He's sticking around and watching this as the flames move closer. But it's the winds in the last hour. I mean, it's been the wind all day, but in the last hour we have to hold on to the tripod with force to ensure that it stays on the ground. So that's how fast the winds are blowing. You can see the black smoke and the flames, but we're going to keep monitoring this out here right now as a number of firefighters from a variety of different agencies working hard to put this out, but they've got a very difficult fight on their hands. And Alex, it's going to be interesting to see with the winds picking up and we're expecting more stronger winds tonight, whether they will be able to get any air support. What about people? Have most of the people left this area? It looks like a literal firestorm where you are on the Santa Ynez. Yeah. Kathy, the roads are so quiet right now, as you would hope. People have largely evacuated the area. There are a few people who have stuck Live reports that these winds are so unpredictable. They're not blowing in just one direction. They're blowing in several directions, and they shift at a moment's notice. So it's tough to tell where these flames are going to go next. And then when you add in this wind, you've got these embers that are flying into the night sky. That's part of the reason that we had to back up. I mean, they were flying these embers. So many of them were flying right at us that we wanted to get out of their direction and move to a safer distance, which is where we're bringing you this live report from right now. But yes, Kathy, to answer your question, most people have heeded the evacuation warnings and left. There are a few that remain, but as you can see, the evacuation is the right move right here. Alex, what about firefighters in the neighborhood? Is there any kind of structure protection? Are you seeing them with hoses pulled out to do anything here? Yeah, we've seen it. Just changes by the block. Really? Colleen. I mean, you know, they they'll work on a home for a moment, but then they've got to move a few homes down a few seconds later. I mean, the winds are moving so fast that once they think they have any kind of a handle on protecting a home, they're going to move away from it and they're taking on their next project. Part of the reason that we're here is that we were up the hill away, about a quarter, half mile away, and we were we were looking at a home on a separate street, and there was a large group of firefighters that took off and we said, where are you guys going? They said, there's six homes on fire on Enchanted Way. So we followed them here. So you know that they've got a lot of people, a lot of resources from a variety of different agencies, and they're as coordinated as they can be. Given the dynamic situation that's unfolding before them. So difficult. Colleen and Kathy, it's so dramatic to watch what we're seeing right now. Alex, could you describe for us what you're feeling, how hot this fire is? The air quality. We can hear the winds. It's just incredible how strong this is. Yes. And the winds have have intensified so much. And we're watching these flames move. And it's a complete firestorm. But as I sit here right now, I think at the very human element here, that there are so many families, many of them probably watching our broadcast or news broadcast tonight, watching and hoping for the best. And right now it's in the hands of Mother Nature and the wind that's blowing everywhere. And there's so many people, some that we've talked to today who have lived in this neighborhood for decades. And they had not seen flames get this close to these homes. And they made the decision to leave. There's not much you can do with your own garden hose here. There's nothing you can do. The it's just too big. It's too much. And they're putting their faith in the firefighters and hoping that the, that the wind will slow. But as I've noted, it's the strongest. We felt it today. As I stand here talking to you right now Alex Rozier thank you for that. Alex on via Santa Ynez. As we've heard time and time again today from people, you can replace things you cannot replace your life. NBC 4's Robert Kovacik continues our team coverage right now. Robert, when we checked in with you last, you were close to Santa Monica, very close to a mobile home park that apparently was catching fire. Not one, but two. I can't show it to you. There is so much I can't show you because in complete transparency, while we were there at the mobile home park, the LAFD came and they said it's just not safe. We got to escort all of you out of here as because they were escorting their own people out of here. We weren't in the way. We were just like them. We just realized it was getting too hot. It was getting too intense. What did we see on our way here? We saw that the tractors that they use for the sand to clear the sand and make sure it's nice, and even here on the beaches, up in flames on this side, on the PCH side, on this side of sunset. Another mobile home park went up in flames. So where we are right now is we're going to consider it safe because this is the command post where it Will Rogers State Beach we are with our good friend, my old friend Captain Eric Scott with the LAFD. Eric, we're going to take a walk because I want our viewers, first of all, to see the manpower that has already assembled here. And as we walk though, and Scott just walk along with us, I got to ask you, first of all, friend to friend, how do you put this fire in all of our years of experience, one of the most challenging due to the most powerful winds that I can really remember. I know we keep comparing it to 2011. There were some significant winds, 2017 was some devastating fires for Los Angeles and Skirball Getty Laguna areas, but this is very powerful, very sporadic. And we're not we're not done yet. Oh, we're not even started. Eric, how does as Scott turn around and show us the manpower that is assembled here, how do we go about trying to fight this fire? Wl, you know, we're setting up a mobile command post to get this extremely organized. We initially need to anchor a fire. You got to be able to stop where it started, and then you flank it. You have progressive hose lays on both sides of the fire. We work to pinch it together and work very closely with aircraft to make strategic water drops at the head of the fire, but this fire doesn't have any containment lines yet. This fire is basically doesn't have it's going in all directions. Right. Exactly. So that will always be the definitive start to any brush fire. Unfortunately, this spotted so quickly in so many directions that we have to just move to evacuating people out of the way. It's simply impossible for us to completely stop the fire when it's this bad of winds. Okay, you've hit the word that we really need to talk about. We have had viewers calling in to NBC 4, fearing, first of all, evacuation orders. We talked about all the Pacific Palisades. When it comes to evacuations. What are we talking about? Give us the lay of the land here. Just how far are we looking in? What directions? Well, there's about 33,000 people in the Pacific Palisades Highlands areas. That was our original concern. And so we worked very closely to do wireless emergency alerts to work with our law enforcement partners to knock on doors and use bullhorns as needed. To use you friends at NBC 4 to talk to the media through traditional and social media are all tools in the toolbox, and having press conferences to keep people informed. And when it comes to getting ready to leave at this point, if you don't have your evacuation kit ready, if you don't have your stuff ready, you may, because of this fire, Eric, just have to get out. Absolutely. You know, people should be well versed by now if you've chosen to live in a brush area to know the ready, set, go program to know that you need to have a kit, to know that you need to have multiple evacuation ways out. So at this point, we want people just to heed our continued warnings and will provide more information as it's necessary. Can you crunch some numbers for me? Eric, can you tell me what we have here in terms of the number of homes lost, the number of acres charred? You know, we got to be pushing close to 3000 acres at this point. We flew it with fixed wing at 2:00. We won't be able to fly it to get accurate data on acreage until tomorrow morning. Containment is at 0%, which is normal for such a sporadic, strong wind driven fire. Homes damaged would be multiple injuries. Is the big one? Yeah. No significant reported injuries. And we're proud of that. I'm hanging on to you, Eric. I'm not trying to hug you. I'm just trying to screw it. I lost that, so we lost a hat. If you see it, I'll just have to pick it up. So we're not going to stay here. I want to stay right here with you. But I want our viewers to see that they are trying just as hard as they can to get resources on this fire. But how do you, at this point, get resources on this fire? Well, we've called for a lot of additional help. We have friends from Cal Fire and Northern California that's coming, and we have Los Angeles County Fire Department, multiple other nearby agencies from Santa Monica. So we have the appropriate quantity and type of resources currently, and we're calling for more. Eric, when it comes to the night ahead, our meteorologists are just telling us that we've got gusts ahead of us. Are you preparing for this? Are you preparing? Is it fair to say for the worst is yet to come? Yeah, absolutely. And to be honest, we're actually we're in the middle of moving this whole command post. We're not going to stay here. Now, that was my next question. So where we are right now, we're Will Rogers State Beach right. We're in the parking lot. Very famous area. I'm sure many of you have been here before. Fire truck after fire truck after fire truck. You can see the personnel that is lining up here. The flames are following us. And when I say following us, they're following us. From the Palisades to Santa Monica. So they're heading east right now. And now we're going to have to move a command post. I can't remember that happened. It does normally happen, and it's usually incremental and small areas. When a first fire breaks out, your command post is near the fire, and then it gets too big and you go to the nearest fire station. Then it gets too big and you got to go to a place like this. But because the fire is spreading so rapidly now down this area, we're actually going to likely move towards Zuma Beach and we're going to pick up these vehicles and reassign Refeed everybody at a different location. So if we move towards Zuma Beach, are we thinking that that is a safe area and that section of Malibu is going to be safe? Yes. Okay. You simply put. We think at this point that's the case. Well, sure. And we felt that this was a safe location, but we have to get continued situational awareness and make the appropriate decisions. And sometimes that's relocating. Eric, listen again. You are you are a professional. Beyond professionals, we have worked with the LAPD and you so closely. But you gotta admit, man, this is one scary, scary day in Southern California. This is one of the worst wind driven fires I've had the privilege of being on. And I'm even on a type one federal incident management team that goes all over the place. And this is extremely challenging when it comes to the resources that you need. You talk about the additional resources that are coming in. Are we looking, you know, from from Northern California, from other areas, Cal Fire coming in and helping us out wherever we need it? Yeah. And that's some of the beauty of automatic and mutual aid. So because this jurisdiction abuts against Los Angeles City, L.A. County, Santa Monica, etc, we already have automatic aid agreements to help each other out. And now that it gets to be so large and long in duration, we are calling in for state resources to assist when it comes to staging. You know, we've got other vulnerable areas throughout Los Angeles. You know, we have other areas from from the Santa Clarita area to the Hollywood Hills that are all waiting to see what's going to spark there. Are we prepared to spread the wealth if we need to get firefighters elsewhere throughout the night and into the next 24 hours? You know, I'll be candid, your Los Angeles City Fire Department needs more firefighters. We recently did an independent study called the Standards of Cover, and the statistics showed that due to how fast Los Angeles is expanding, that we absolutely do need additional boots on the ground. So this is very challenging. We appreciate, you know, any funding. I know the fire chief is putting forth some some new funding to be able to mitigate these problems. And we're doing the best with with what we got. We're going to have updates soon in terms of where we go this evening and what happens next. Yes, we will continue to provide updates. We do have a joint information center downtown LA at the Emergency Operations Center. Again, we have a team here that's gathering information. We'll have a formal press conference at 8 a.m. Tomorrow as well. Eric. And is it fair to say, as we take a look at members of the LAPD that have been here as well, we also want to just applaud their efforts throughout, throughout the day, trying to get people out of harm's way and evacuated. Eric, is it fair to say that we've got the majority right now of people living in Los Angeles that should be prepared to leave at a moment's notice right now? You know, we're dealing with new normals, right? These wildfires are increasing in severity and duration. We say there's no longer a fire season. It's year round. And if anybody is in these areas, you don't have to wait until we tell you to go. To go. We encourage you to leave early. That really assists us with not having a bottleneck of egress. People coming out while big fire trucks are trying to come in. Eric, if there's one thing I can tell our viewers, and I know you standing here as well, we have the best firefighters in the world here trying to get this under control, trying to stop the force of Mother Nature that right now is winning the battle. But eventually we're going to put our footprint on her. So thank you so much. And again, my friend, always good to see you. And I again. Any last words for the folks here that have been watching all day the, the firefighting effort and the valiant efforts that you all have been trying to do. I think you nailed it. You know, your firefighters couldn't be trying harder. It's very arduous work that they're doing in extreme conditions, and we're doing the absolute best we can to protect life and property. Captain Eric Scott, thank you again. We're going to, of course, be in touch as as we go back to you. You just look here at the hillsides again. We're talking about now having to move a command post. You've heard Eric talk about having to move command posts before, but I've never seen a command post this that's so big in scope that now has to move. They're going to relocate to Zuma Beach, but anything can change. As I will tell you, driving from sunset and PCH here to Will Rogers, there was nothing but fire and destruction on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway. Let's go back to you. And we've been so focused on this area, Robert, thank you. And thank you to Captain Eric Scott with LA fire for joining us with that very latest information out there and their plans throughout the night. But we were just hearing about another fire that sparked over in Eaton Canyon in the Altadena area. So that's going to be something that we're going to be watching with the erratic winds tonight. We definitely will. I've just got some pictures, in fact, from my neighbors. We're trying to get more information on that. And we'll bring it to you as soon as we get it. But as Kathy mentioned, that's in the Altadena Eaton Canyon area, very visible if you're driving down the 210 or the 134 in that area. Now, NBC 4's Karma Dickerson is live along Carmel Lane with more on what's happening, give us an idea of the neighborhood you're in here. Karma. Well, Carmel is not very far from Lockman, and I know we've become all too familiar with Lockman Lane. We're actually right at the intersection of Carmel and Lockman, where we've seen home after Home burn. Now, we don't want to give the impression that the entire neighborhood is gone, but it certainly is not uncommon to drive down one of these side streets and see a house here, a house there on fire. And that's exactly what we have right over my shoulder. This is the house right on the corner of Lockman and Carmel. And this was a home under construction, according to what firefighters told us. And as we pulled up, we could see the framing. We can still see some of the structure in place. And by the time we were parked and set, it's all come to the ground. Firefighters have not been idle here while making their stand for this place. They also put in a lot of effort to make sure those flames did not move to the nearby home. Those flames even reaching over to the brush. The bushes up there. But the firefighters were there, putting the flames out, trying to make sure that the fire did not spread. We talked earlier about potential issues with water. They said that they did have a water tanker just come on scene, and that was very helpful to them because they say that the fire hydrants, at least in this particular area, are mostly dry, pretty empty. And so they were relying on outside water being brought in to try to fight these fires. So just an additional challenge that they're working with on this section of roadway, we can see that there is a I'm not sure if you can see in the distance, but a little bit of an orange glow. We know just below us is where Alex Rozier is reporting from. There are many houses on fire above us further up on Lockman. We also have some houses on fire. So it is a you know, it's a neighborhood that is dealing with some significant challenges, especially as these winds continue to kick up. We're going to take a little bit of a step back because the embers are pushing back our way, and we know how much of a threat those embers can be actually can see them. Khalid, if you can see over to the left, it looks like some of the embers have caught the brush. The brush right here, a little bit of the brush. And so the fire is starting to make it off of this property. And again, that's what firefighters are really worried about. They recognize that this property is gone, but they're concerned about what happens if these flames spread. And that's why they're continuing to make a stand on this street and continuing to do everything they can to monitor this. So that is the latest from Sharm El, just one of the side streets off Lockman, a main thoroughfare that has been hit so very hard during this fire hours and hours now firefighters have spent on this street trying to save what they can. I'll send it back to you. All right. Thank you so much. Karma. As she navigates the streets there, we want to see if we can bring back in NBC 4's Alex Rozier. Last time, Alex, you were on via. Santa Ynez. So let's find out where you are right now. It looks like some fire behind you there. Alex, can you hear us right now? Hey, y'all. I my earpiece is not working, so I apologize, but we are at via Santa Ynez. And Hakan, I want to give you a live look behind me, because earlier we gave you a perspective on the hillside. But we've watched this fire as it has moved down and further down this road again on a cone right now, as we step out here a little bit and give you a live look, we have been watching the winds intensify. The gusts are getting stronger. And with that, this fire has moved down this hill. Earlier today, we spoke with a man who's been watching this from the corner at that intersection at Via Santa Ynez and Cone, and he has now alerted fire crews to come and address the new fire that's burning here. A couple homes down. You'll see here there's another crew that's moving in. One thing about where we are right now is that there's only one way in, one way out. That appears to be Cal Fire. There are a variety of agencies that we've seen here at. But I want to I want to point you in the direction on the left side of your screen there, because that's the new flames that we've seen here as we've been standing in the last 15 minutes. So enchanted way, if you live in the neighborhood, if you live near Enchanted Way in El Toro, that's where we were earlier. There were several homes that caught fire. And it appears that it's moving downhill right now. So we're going to keep monitoring this and bring you the latest as we have it, guys. We'll send it back into you. Alex, you've been in several neighborhoods in that area today. Can you give us an idea of just ballpark it because we don't have a number, and the fire department hasn't been able to count the number of homes destroyed yet. More than a handful, more than ten, fewer than ten. What have you seen? Okay, look, you know, it sounds like he doesn't have his earpiece, which helps him hear us. So he's not able to hear. But we can look at these live pictures right now. And we have seen from his reports that several homes have been destroyed. And we know that the numbers are far greater than that. Many homes here have been lost. He also said that there were some people still in that area, but most have evacuated. Most got the warnings, as we all did. If you're in the county on your phone that told you, now is the time to get out. And thankfully they have. But we want to bring in meteorologist David Biggar right now. Oh hey two seconds real quick. Earlier he had said there was a handful. And the reason I asked him that question was because he moved to another neighborhood and there were several more, you know, by our count, it's at least a dozen homes lost so far between Darsha and Alex Bowen and Karma is live shots out there. Yeah. I mean, and no containment. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me. I mean, we've seen from all of our reporters tonight, all the embers that are flying around out there, and there are so many tall trees and palm trees and palm trees, especially the fronds just become just torches. They're just embers that go everywhere. And every single ember that flies out there can become an additional spot fire. I've actually got an example of that. This is from a previous fire. This is from the bridge fire that was near the mountain high area. So the fire is over in the trees here. This meadow is what we're going to be focusing on. Notice how there's no fire happening now. I'm going to play this out in real time, although we will pause it briefly here so you can see the seconds elapse on the side. We're going to pause right about here because you'll notice the screen is filled with all this noise. You see all these little bits and pieces. This is all ash and embers. And so these are the kind of embers that we're seeing with the current fire right now that's burning in the Pacific Palisades that are just blowing around in the wind. It only takes one of these to start a spot fire, and you can see how many are on the screen right here. These are all landing in this meadow down below. And now watch as we go from about six seconds to just a few more seconds. How many individual fires start popping up in this meadow? And before you know it, we start getting into that 22nd category. Here. We've got spot fires all over this meadow, and this fire has not even come past the tree line just yet. But now this is preheating all of that area out ahead of the fire, which is allowing it to quickly sweep out of the trees. So that is an example of spotting. And that's a short distance with the wind speeds that we have right now, we're likely spotting several thousand feet, if not a mile out ahead of it. So here's the current conditions that we're looking at. I want to point out one thing. The observation site around Topanga Beach may have been around where part of the fire has reached out to PCH. This is on the opposite side of PCH from the ocean. And so that's why the wind direction might be a little bit weird. It's pointing out to the south. I did see the temperature spikes that may have happened there, that it might be a false wind observation direction, but still seeing gusts of 46 miles an hour. Pacific Palisades. The gusts are picking up. Look at the ridgetop winds though. 43 mile an hour sustained winds right now. And we've got gusts up above 60 miles an hour. I also want to point out this fire area that you're seeing here outlined in red. We have had trouble updating it because the fire keeps growing so quickly. It's more just an indicator of the general area that the fire was burning earlier. It is definitely spread outside of that area. And now we also have another report of a brush fire. This is in the Altadena area near Eden Canyon. So Eden Canyon runs right about through here. Right now, the wind speeds in the Altadena area, about 34 mile per hour gusts. We're also seeing gusts of 30 miles an hour in Sierra madre, but up in some of the peaks, we're still seeing some pretty impressive gusts. In fact, this is what it looks like right now from our Mount Wilson camera. You can see the fire. So currently, if you are in the San Gabriel Valley, you are probably starting to smell smoke because all the smoke from this is going to go straight south. And that will eventually work its way into the Basin as well. So now it looks like we have two potential fires burning in the area. And our concern for tonight is that we are still looking at some very strong wind gusts, especially for the San Gabriel Valley. As we get into the evening hours. So you can actually see, actually, it was interesting as I was looking at the Mount Wilson camera there, I did also see a flash down in the lower elevations. Would not be surprised if we have a power line coming down with any trees that are falling, but I'm actually going to switch to one more map here. Okay, so here's what it looks like. The wind gusts Futurecast focusing more on the San Gabriel Valley as we go through the next couple of hours. This is 8 p.m. Look at the wind speeds around Pasadena. Look at the wind gusts around Duarte, Glendora, all in that 40 to 50 mile per hour range. But it looks like we may see even stronger gusts as we get closer to midnight. So this is 11 p.m. Now look at these wind gusts in the 50 to 60 mile per hour range. So that fire that you're seeing right now on the screen that's near. That's from our Mount Wilson camera that's in this area right about in here. We're going to be looking at potentially seeing 50 mile per hour wind gusts working through that area. This is another one of the concerns for firefighters. Obviously we've got strong wind gusts coming our way. We may have trees coming down tonight as we go through the overnight hours. And the other thing working against firefighters in any fire area tonight, you have now burned through trees. They are weak and they are going to have very strong wind gusts coming through. All right David, thank you. On the phone with us right now is Captain Sheila Kelliher, L.A. County Fire Pio captain, we're looking at a picture right now from Mount Wilson, captain of the Altadena Eaton Canyon fire. What can you tell us about this? It looks large. Yeah, as of right now, they have it at 20 acres. That doesn't mean it hasn't grown since that. That notification was put out about ten minutes ago. It does have the potential to go to 500 acres quickly. So, like like your guy was saying with the wind, it's going to it's going to grow quickly, I'm afraid. Is this what you're referring to as the close fire? And what else can you tell us about support right now to try to get a handle on it at all? Yeah. Well, like like everything. I'm over here. Actually, I'm sitting here at the Palisades Fire watching the fire come down the hill towards us. So we've got a ton of resources on this one, but you have all of East County, so you've got people spread out throughout the county to, to help support. So they're going to have everybody in position to help do what they can on this fire as well. And one of the problems is we have seen the winds. They are erratic and they are very strong, and they're occurring in the valley as well, and maybe peaking tonight once again, the brush is also very dry. Can you talk about the problems that we're having with the conditions? Yeah, this is a perfect storm, right? We haven't had rain, significant rain over the last three years and the last eight months for sure. These are the most extreme wind conditions we've seen in a decade. And you combine that with low relative humidity, high winds, high sustained gusting winds, like you said, up to 50 miles an hour later this evenin. And our low fuel moisture and it just you put it in somewhere like Eaton Canyon. That topography just breeds more wind and more weather. So it's the worst case scenario, to be honest. Captain, what can you tell us about evacuations? How many people in the area there? I don't have the latest numbers on the evacuation for Eaton Canyon, but there are evacuations. I you know what? Like I said, since my focus is over here on this fire, I haven't looked at the genesis. I don't see the evacuation notices. But again, I'm not 100% up to what they're doing yet. So I'm getting that information as we speak. Is it burning close to homes over there? Do you know that? Are you talking about Eaton Canyon? Eaton Canyon? Yes, we've been watching what's going on in the Palisades very closely. So we're wondering about Eden Canyon. I've received texts from people in the Rose Bowl area, Linda Vista area. You know, people are concerned, wondering if and when they should begin to put things together to get out. They they definitely will put out those notifications, those warnings and those orders. From what I do read here, though, the structure defense is being established along Pine Crest Drive near Kanaloa Canyon Road. So I think they're worried about Niello Canyon. Kinneloa Canyon area is their first priority for structure defense. All right. But as always, when you have a fire in the area or these conditions, always get ready to go. Captain Sheila, thank you so much for joining us. Right now, we're approaching our hour. We are at 7:00, and we're also continuing our coverage of the Palisades Fire. Besides that close fire, which just sparked in Altadena. Good evening. I'm Kathy Vara and I'm Colleen Williams. Several homes have been destroyed. People are scrambling to get out of harm's way. We're talking about the fire in the Palisades area. We're pretty scared because, you know, there were fires everywhere. There were burning embers on the ground. You know, the smoke was like stinging our eyes. My wife described it as like being in a war zone. NBC 4 News at Seven starts with breaking news. All right. At this hour, Governor Newsom has declared a state of emergency for the Palisades Fire. Flames exploding in size at least 12 homes, a dozen homes, more than a dozen burned. And right now, nearly 3000 acres. And we have the very latest for you now at seven, that number of a dozen homes or so expected to increase. But that's just what we've seen from our crews in the area. Many people have been told to leave their homes. At least 30,000 people evacuated there. Some people just left their cars in the middle of the road at sunset and Temescal to get to safety. And apparently, according to our meteorologist and the fire department here, fire officials, we have not yet seen the worst of the winds. Yet more than 10,000 homes threatened our team of reporters. As you've seen spread out throughout the area, trying to give you the most up to date information on all of this. And once again, we're trying to get more information on that. Altadena, Eaton Canyon situation. The fire that I believe Kathy, the Pio captain said is at 20 acres at this point but had the potential to grow much, much bigger. And you see why they have to move resources when these pop up, as they do in NBC 4's. Tracey Leong is near the firefighter command post that set up right now in Pacific Palisades, but that too may move soon. Tracey. Yeah, Kathy and Colleen. And this is the reason why they are getting ready to move again. See those massive flames? They are just inching closer and closer. And that's actually why we moved over here. We were about a quarter mile down the way. Still on Will Rogers State Beach along PCH. And we saw these flames just moving south along the hillside, even jumping over PCH, burning palm trees along the beach. We even saw an outhouse burning and the entire area was so smoky. It was thick black smoke. So my photographer, Sean Browning, and I decided it was safer to move over here to the command post. But as you just mentioned, they are getting ready to move. They are moving up to Zuma Beach, which is north of here, and it's going to be a much safer area because these winds are so unpredictable. They are so extreme and they are moving these flames quickly. And we've already seen it jump over PCH. We've already seen it come over to this area. They have a lot of resources out here, a lot of emergency personnel. So their concern is getting to an area that is a lot safer because it is just extremely unpredictable. These winds so powerful, even knocking over a lot of us reporters as we stand out here and take a look at this outhouse. The wind is so strong. It knocked this over as well. And those embers are continuing to fly in and spark new fires as we speak. But that's the very latest out here. Kathy Colleen, back to you. All right, Tracy, thank you for that. We're going to switch live right now to our one of our other reporters on scene out there. She's been out there all afternoon. Darsha Philips is on sunset for us. Darsha. Yeah. Colleen. Right now, sunset Boulevard at Temescal Canyon completely blocked off as firefighters tried to put out a fire of an apartment building. You can see the trucks blocking the area here. And in the distance you can see a long ladder with a firefighter putting water on top of that large apartment building, trying to keep it from those flames from really engulfing it and taking it down. Now the issue is there are still people here who are trying to evacuate, like Barbara and her husband. They live on Sunset Boulevard. They just left their home and they are unable to get past this. Barbara, tell me you just left your house and how is your house doing right now? At the moment it was standing when we left. And where are you guys trying to go? We're trying to get into Santa Monica. We have friends who live there who invited us to spend the night. We should have left a little bit sooner, I'm afraid. How are you feeling right now? I mean, I know you've said you've lived in this area for a very long time, but these winds and these conditions are very intense, very stressful. And the fact that there are so many things going on at the same time, you can't you don't want to impede the trucks, the fire trucks, and yet there's fire burning all around you. And you have to be aware of it. And you came up the street. And right now firefighters have told you that you just got to sit here and wait for a minute. That's correct, I hope. I hope it's less. I hope it's less than a minute. I fear it's going to be much longer. But buildings on fire. Yeah. Across the street. Absolutely. Well, you guys be safe. Thank you so much for talking to us again. They live on Sunset Boulevard. They are trying to evacuate. We also see several cars behind them, possibly residents who are doing the same thing. Now I want to walk up Sunset Boulevard to give you an idea of the operation that is going on right now. We have lots of first responders and firefighters here trying to keep this massive apartment complex from going up in flames, so we are telling they are actually trying to get these folks off of the road so they can move their big vehicles. So they are trying to get the folks that are waiting to get through Sunset Boulevard, to try to get them to leave, because right now, Sunset Boulevard, as I mentioned, is completely shut down because of this operation. But I do want to walk up this way to show you a little bit of what is happening now. Colleen, earlier you asked, you know, are there are we seeing water being put on this fire? And this is actually the first time we're really seeing a long ladder up and fire and water being put on that fire. Take a look at this apartment complex. It is massive and they have been working for quite some time to try to stop these flames. But take a look at it. That first floor is completely engulfed in flames right now, and that's what they're trying to do. They're trying their best to keep it from spreading to the other floors. But unfortunately, that probably may go up in flames. Which is why right now, what we're seeing are firefighters moving out of Sunset Boulevard. And we've also are walking back down Sunset Boulevard as folks are being asked to move past this blockage so we can get these big trucks out of here. We've also seen big first responders try to get through to that area as well. Yeah, Darsha in some of those areas, the roads are narrow and they have all that equipment in there, and it is just a puzzle trying to get the people out, trying to get the equipment in and to make any sense in all this chaos that's going on. But hopefully everyone who is in that building was evacuated. Hopefully we haven't seen. Were we were actually there earlier. There's an assisted living home that was right next to that building. And all of the evacuations happened much earlier. It was a very dramatic situation to try and get all of those folks out, so they were able to get everyone out of that building. But again, they're trying to save that building right now, and we are going to move. Oh, they're going to come right through here. They're going to try and open this, this. So we are actually going to get out of their way. I'm going to send it back to you so we can move our truck. Good idea. All right. Darsha thank you. The one thing Kathy, as I look at her picture there, it looks like there may be a little bit of a lull in the wind out there. I mean, before when we would go to Darsha, she could barely stand up in the wind. Let's ask Alex Rozier, who's a little ways away from there. He continues our live team coverage. What's the wind situation right now? Alex? Colleen, it's rapidly intensified over the last couple of hours, specifically in the last hour, there have been moments where we've had to hold on to the tripod because the wind was so strong, the camera would blow over. We are in a neighborhood that's been hit hard by fire here. Derek Bok lives a few blocks away. You've stuck around today, Derek. You've been around this neighborhood for 20 years. First, I want to say via Santa Ynez and J. Con were right near Marquez Elementary. Tell me about your day, your experience so far? It's been a little harrowing. It started off this morning where I. I saw a small plume of smoke, and I was concerned all morning, obviously, because the wind was so strong and I saw the small plume of smoke. And about 30 minutes later I thought, maybe we'll be okay, because it was blowing a little bit to the side of us, but it's just spread everywhere. So it's been a day of watching it and kind of keeping tabs and helping out neighbors and, you know, a few crazy things going on. Absolutely. And I want to give a live look at that straight ahead. We're looking directly to the north here at Enchanted Way, where there are several homes that have caught fire. You used to live a few homes down from where we're standing. But I want to go to your point on the neighbor. You actually said that a few of you worked to help save a neighbor's house. Is that right? There was a neighbor's house that we were walking by with a with a retired firefighter and looked over and saw a fire on the side of the house. So we ran up there and my son had a fire extinguisher and put it partially out, but it was it was too big for that. So we got we were able to get a hose and put water on it for about 5 or 10 minutes and got it out, and then found that the guest house door was also open with the curtains blowing in the wind. And, you know, embers were flying all over. So we were able to shut that and get that fire out. So maybe it saved the house, I don't know, 20 years in the neighborhood. Have you ever seen flames this close to so many homes? I've never seen flames like this. No, this this is the first time we've had a lot of fires. I've seen a lot of smoke. And a few times I've seen, you know, the red glare. But I've never seen homes that I actually, I know these houses because I've lived here for 20 years. I know which house that is that's burning. I know which houses they are right next to mine that are burning. So it's nothing like this ever. You know, these houses and you know many of these people. I want to end with this just on a, on a human note tonight. Just what's your feeling watching this neighborhood that you care about, the people that you you care about here. What has this been like? Really hard. I think it it really hit me when I heard that all the trees around Poly High were burning because I have. My youngest son is still going to Poly high. So, you know, hope hopefully that the high school survives. I don't know, I haven't been down there yet, so it's you know, I teared up a few times. Well, we're going to be watching this with you tonight. Give you a live look one more time. Derek, thank you so much for your time. I wish the best for you and your family. This neighborhood looking at Enchanted Way in the distance there. We were there earlier. We saw several homes that had caught fire on that roadway, specifically near the intersection of Enchanted Way and El Oro. And we've been watching this, this fire continue to grow. And not just the fire continuing to grow. We've we've watched the wind intensify. And that is what we're looking at right now. And we expect that that wind will continue to be strong into the night. So we're just hoping for the best for this neighborhood. Colleen all the people and the families, the homes that are here, we'll send it back. Very emotional, very emotional night there. Alex, is he planning to stay? What is he doing? How long will he be there? Derek, one more question for you. They're asking about your plans here. As far as you're sticking around right now, what is your evacuation plan? I'm leaving. I'm out of here. I just wanted to stop for a second and see what the progress is with the fire right here, because I've got a lot of friends that knew I was still at the house. And a lot of friends around me wanted to know the status of their houses, so I let them know. But it's time to go. It's time to go. Thank you. Thank you very much. He's going to listen to that evacuation order and head out of the neighborhood tonight. Kathy and Colleen. All right. Alex Rozier, thank you for that. We're covering this other breaking news, this other fire. This is a new fire we've been talking about in Altadena. You can see there are pictures here. Viewer photos. This one is burning in the hills towards the Eaton Canyon hiking area. If you're familiar with the area, it's a beautiful area with waterfalls there. It's just south of Mount Wilson. This fire is growing very, very quickly. We spoke with a Pio with La La County fire just a few moments ago, and she said, this one has burned about 20 acres so far. This is also a wind driven fire. We're keeping a close eye on this one from our cameras on top of Mount Wilson live cameras up there, we can tell you we have several crews on the way, so we will get more information on this. I don't know about you, but that plume looks larger in those pictures. She did say it has the potential to grow to 500 acres. Anybody who's been up there knows it's a very wilderness area, but there are a lot of homes and densely populated area in the foothills there as well. It's a popular area, very dear to many, many people. All right. Joining us on the phone right now. Now, Larry Wilk, he is live at the helipad at JPL. We know you're watching water drops. Is that correct? That would be a wonderful thing. What can you see? And can you hear us, Larry? I can hear you. You know, I am standing right at the spot that's on the top of JPL, where they've established fire trucks here, up to a hydrant, where they're waiting for the helicopters to come in. We've not seen any helicopters yet. We've got one helicopter from the L.A. County Fire Department that flew by without water and is observing and tracking the fire. We don't know if he's dropping water from another location, but I can tell you that just in the last few minutes, this fire has really blown up. And I would say much more than 20 acres at this point. It's racing up the hill against the wind. Driven by this wind that's coming from the north, and the wind is steadily picking up here where I'm standing. But a huge plume of smoke is blowing all across Altadena and Pasadena right now. I first got up here, I saw several transformers exploding down just below the fire in the area down by Altadena and the Eaton. Eaton Canyon Recreation Area and the Kanaloa Flats area is also in danger right now. But for those people that that live in Altadena and Pasadena, they are definitely feeling the effects of this fire. In fact, I spoke to one person who lives on Altadena Boulevard who told me that he is trying to race to his home right now to get whatever he can out because the wind is and the embers are just blowing across and into those neighborhoods that are just south of the fire right now. So a terrible situation for firefighters already stretched so thin right now. And I can tell you that there are a dozen or so that are up here at the helipad waiting for the L.A. County Fire Department to come and load up their helicopters with water and start making drops on this fire. But it's extremely windy up there, so could be very tough for them to get into these canyons where they need to, to try and get ahead of the fire. Larry, I know you're a chopper pilot. I know you're familiar with the area. How close are these flames, do you think, to homes in the area? Is this at the top of lake? It is at the top of lake. And? And it's. And points east of Lake as well. But it's extremely close. In fact, we just saw a giant transformer explode. If you're I know that you're familiar with the area as well, and you know that they've got these large transmission lines that run east and west in the foothill areas up there just above the population. And those are being you can see those wires exploding at the same time. So I think it's an extreme danger for the people that live in that area. The south of the Eaton Canyon Recreation Area. So any of those homes in Altadena. But, you know, we're seeing a rapid, rapid intensification of flames right now. We're seeing the fires are steadily making their march east and west along that ridge line. And so while the wind is not as bad as predicted, it's going to be tonight. It's not supposed to get any better. And so again, I think if they're giving you an evacuation order down there, from what I'm seeing and my vantage point with the exploding transformers, the wind, the embers being carried, I mean, some of these embers are being carried almost halfway down to the to the 210 freeway. So that'll give you just a good idea of how intense this fire is. But it's really blowing up right now. Yeah, we can see we can tell that it's really blowing up. And I just wondered if you talk to your friend, did he say anything about getting an evacuation alert tonight? So he got a call. He is also in a helicopter pilot who does firefighting suppression. And he got a call from somebody at his base and said, we know that you live nearby, and until you're off duty, you may want to go. And so he didn't get anything official, but but he said that he's he does get the official evacuation and he's going to pack up and get as much out as he can in the way of files and paperwork. But, Larry, I'm not sure if you can still hear us. You're breaking up just a little bit, knowing the conditions out there. As a chopper pilot, do you see that they'll do any aerial assault on this tonight? They could. These guys, you know, they are great at what they do. And more importantly, they know this area so well. They know where the wires are. They know the pattern of the wind. With this level of wind, I'd say we're getting a sustained wind of around 20 miles an hour right now, with gusts up to 3540 miles an hour. And these L.A. County Fire Blackhawks, Firehawk helicopters, they can handle that kind of wind. It's not a smooth ride, but they can definitely handle it. We just don't see them out here. Of course, they've probably been working nonstop on the Palisades Fire. But. And you probably already mentioned this, but because of the presidential TFR, temporary flight restriction, we're not able to get any of our news helicopters up in the air. And that's why we're not able to provide the aerial coverage that we normally do. That's a very good point, because we have the president here. And so you have those restrictions, but we have some great other ground photos and some ground video. Now are live pictures where we can see the status of it. And this is a live picture, I believe, on the left hand side from Mount Wilson, our live camera up there, Larry, for people who know the area, we talked about it being sort of at the top of Lake, the Altadena Country Club is up there. There are some camps for children up there. Is this burning towards that or away from it? It is burning absolutely toward those camps and all. I would say that that, you know, it's tough to tell exactly where it is from my vantage point. But but if I can tell you this, when I got on the 210 freeway tonight from Sunland-tujunga and I got over the peak at about Lowell Avenue, I thought that it that this is going to be an enormous fire. That's how far away I couldn't tell where it was. I thought it might have been closer to La Canada. I drove up to the to the pad to see if I could talk to one of the firefighters and, and that's when I saw where it was. And then I spoke with a friend of mine who lived on Altadena Boulevard, and he said that it's burning right at the Eaton Canyon Recreation Area. That's so those folks in that area are definitely getting a lot of smoke embers. And again, they're probably without power in many of those areas because of all the transformer explosions that have been caused. But I don't know if you can still hear me, but the wind is really picking up right now here in La Canada, and I can see that plume is burning. The plume of smoke is just being just pushed straight over. It's not it's not up in the air. It's blowing towards. Pasadena. And those areas right now. And it's again, I, I saw the beginning of the Palisades fire this morning and, and this one is putting up an equal amount of smoke right now. Oh. All right. Well, always a news guy, Larry Wilk. Thank you. Stay in touch, please. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. We're going to check in with meteorologist David Biggar right now. I watched your forecast last night. You said the valleys were one of the areas that we were going to be watching, that we don't usually have to worry about. Yeah, that's exactly right. One of the areas that we are really concerned about is the San Gabriel Valley, which typically is not looking at some of the strongest winds during Santa Ana wind event. But in this case, it is a totally different windstorm than what we're typically used to seeing with the Santa Ana wind. So we're going to start off with the close fire that is the fire that we were just talking about in the Altadena area. So we're still working on fine tuning exactly where this little flame icon should be. But the observation sites nearby are all showing winds about 10 to 20 miles an hour, with wind gusts in the 30 to 40 mile per hour range. You can see the La Cañada Flintridge looking at wind gusts almost at that 40 mile per hour mark. All spots reporting relatively low humidity only about 20% or so. So if you're in any of these foothill communities right along that urban wildland interface, you need to have a go bag ready. And you need to really pay attention here to any official notices that come out from firefighters, police, any officials about any evacuation orders. Because we've already seen today how quickly things can be moving and spotting with embers blowing down the hill. So we're going to continue to monitor that. We're also still monitoring the Palisades fire and the conditions around it. The wind gusts are picking up in a couple of spots around the Santa Monica mountains. Currently, 60 mile per hour gusts being reported at ridgelines with wind speeds at about 40 to 45 miles an hour. Down near Topanga Beach. Look at the wind gusts. Now we have seen that pick up to about 52 miles an hour and around the Pacific Palisades area, the wind gusts have been bouncing around between about 20 to 30 miles an hour, occasionally a bit stronger than that. And the wind directions have also been shifting a bit, generally out of the north and the northeast. However, because of all of our canyons here, all of our little valleys that run about north to south through the Santa Monica mountains, we're getting a lot of channeling of the winds, and that is causing some erratic wind directions for firefighters, especially in areas closer to Pacific Palisades. Since we have a couple of canyons that sort of exit, all in that Pacific Palisades area, I wanted to show you what the wind gusts are looking like as we go through the next couple of hours, because it's 730 almost, we're still not at the peak of this wind event. We're likely going to be watching for the strongest gusts to arrive as we get closer to 10 p.m. Or later. So this is what it looks like by midnight tonight, and you can see what I'm talking about, especially around the San Fernando Valley. So we've got the San Fernando Valley on here and Ventura County. This is a bit of a zoomed in view of wind. Futurecast also get to the rest of the region in just a second, but you can see south of the Santa Monica mountains, you see all that purple color that's hugging right against the coastline. That's all wind gusts in the 40 to 50 mile per hour range. San Fernando Valley, looking at wind gusts in the 40 to 50 mile per hour range around this time as well. So we're likely going to start seeing some trees come down and some more power outages. And you can see that the winds last all the way into the early morning hours. This is 7:00 in the morning, still very gusty out there. It's not until we get into the afternoon and evening hours that the winds finally shut down. So we still have a lot of wind ahead of us over the next couple of hours. Same for the San Gabriel Valley. This is why we're very concerned about that new fire near the Altadena area. Because by 9 p.m, we're looking at wind gusts in that area in the 40 to 50 mile per hour range and intensifying. We could potentially be around that 60 mile per hour gust range, especially through some of the upper elevations. And again, we have to wait until we get into the late afternoon hours for Wednesday for these winds to finally start to wrap up across the region. And even then, you can sort of see it on the edge of the map here. This is the IE wind tunnel south of Cone Pass. It is still very windy well into the afternoon hours. We might get another little pulse of wind coming our way as we get into the late Thursday night early Friday time frame, so we are not out of the woods yet with the winds. We are still waiting for them to really intensify over the next couple of hours. We could potentially see in the valleys. As Kathy was mentioning, some of those gusts in the 50 to 60 mile per hour range or higher. Kathy and Colleen, back to you. All right, David, we are getting an update on the Altadena fire, also known as the close fire. There are mandatory evacuations underway right now. That one has grown to 200 acres. I'm actually getting texts from friends who live in the area saying everybody in their neighborhood is trying to get out. They've turned off the power in some neighborhoods there, and they said there are traffic jams as people are trying to leave this fire. So once again, we have a couple of crews en route to the area, and we'll keep you posted with any and all information we get. There are a lot of homes in that area near Eaton Canyon, a lot of homes. All right. We're going to check in with NBC 4's Karma Dickerson. She is live along Lockman Lane to fill us in on how things are looking out there right now, and we see flames behind you. Yes, we're back along, Lockman. Yet another house we found that has caught fire. Now, what's interesting about this one is this is yet another case of a house that we passed by not too long ago, and there appeared to be nothing going on. And then the next time we pass by, we could see fire coming over the top of this house. Another thing to point out about this house, and we should note that we're on the 1200 block. I believe this is 1266 Lockman. And another thing to point out is there were fire trucks here when we first came, and we saw crews that were pulling up their hoses and appeared to be moving out. And so I asked what was going on, and they said that the fire appeared to be in the back of the home, and it was going to overtake the home. And they said they did not have the resources to put the fire out. And so it appears that they assumed that the house was going to be lost and they have moved on. I asked them what they meant by resources. They said they couldn't get into a lot of detail. I asked what the water situation was, and they said that there continues to be low water pressure in the neighborhood. So whether that contributed to their decision to move on is unclear, but to be very clear, firefighters were here. They saw the house, they saw the fire coming in. They assessed it and they moved on. As we are looking at houses around this area, we can't stress how how much this is unusual from what we typically see on fires, the way the wind is driving, the erratic behavior of the fire because of the way the wind is driving it, there's no telling which house is going to be hit next. There are areas where it seems like, well, we were already here and it didn't seem like there was much going on, but then we come back again and now there is a new fire. A lot of times you'll have a fire and it just moves through an area and it seems like, okay, well, the fire is moving in this direction. There's a new area that needs to be concerned, but no, we're going back. We're revisiting areas that we've already seen and that we're seeing new fire there. Look at how the embers are moving, blowing across this property, blowing into the bushes, potentially blowing into another property. And it gives you an idea of why this fire continues to be such a challenge, to get a handle on. The conditions are so challenging that it's hard to fight against them. And it appears that firefighters are having to be strategic about where they can make a stand, and having to make some tough choices about what they can and cannot save in these cases. Again, we're on Lockman just at the corner of Sharmell, and just another story of another home that struggling at this time. We also want to show you over to the left hand side of the screen. If you take a look up on the hillside, the glow of the fire that is still bearing down on this neighborhood, on this community. The firefighters just behind us, we're just working to put out a fire that was in the front, appeared to be in the front yard of the house that was white. They're trying to put out fire that was appeared to be moving. So doing what they can. But leaving some for loss will take another look at this house here. It's the 1200 block of Lockman. Another house that is going to be lost to this Palisades fire. I'll send it back to you. Have you seen today? How many homes have you seen lost? Personally, standing in front of them. I've seen at least six that are lost. And most of them have been along this corridor along Lockman. Now, when? Just about a half an hour ago, we were standing in a backyard off of Vista Grande with a gentleman who was showing us the view of the neighborhood from below. And from there we could see about ten. That was an overview of the area that Alex Rozier has been reporting from. So I don't want you to add those numbers to the total, but just looking down on the area where Alex was, I can see at least ten other homes that it looked like had burned from there. So but personally, standing in front of them, I can say I watched at least six in the distance. That number grows considerably. All right, Carmen, thank you. It is just after 730. Right now we are following two fires burning in our area in Southern California. We have the Palisades Fire, where Karma was burning nearly 3000 acres. So far, more than a dozen homes have burned there in Pacific Palisades. An evacuation shelter has been set up at Westwood Recreation Center that is at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. And we're also tracking the Eaton fire, also known as a close fire, in Altadena. We understand this one has grown to at least 200 acres so far, and that's just in about 30 minutes. NBC 4's Robert Kovacik continues our live team coverage. Robert, give us an idea of where you are at this point. Well, Colleen, it's pretty dark, but I can tell you that we are at PCH and this is Temescal Canyon, and what you are looking at is another complex that appears to be completely destroyed. We are driving through here with a specific purpose, and we're not going to linger here because this is very dangerous territory that we're treading through right now. This is on PCH, just west of Temescal. And this right now we're looking at a complex. It says Tahitian Terrace that looks like it is completely gone. And then you look on the other side of PCH. I don't you see right here gone. I don't even know what this is. It's burning. It looks like some type of facility, some type of lot. But you can see here it's tough to breathe because there's a lot of rubber in there that I'm smelling. But you can see right here, this is the beach side of PCH that you are looking at right now, just completely in flames. And so you have fire on both sides of Pacific Coast Highway here. As we drive back towards the Palisades, the reason why we are driving back towards the Palisades is we have just learned from Commander Steve Lurie, who once who runs the LAPD West Operations Bureau. And please know this if you are home, they have begun evacuating Mandeville Canyon from sunset to Mulholland. They have begun. And I repeat, this is brand new information from the LAPD. They have begun at this hour at 733 to evacuate Mandeville Canyon from sunset to Mulholland. So that is one other area. Another neighborhood, homes in that area, large homes in that area. There's horse trailers already there that our photographer, David Gregory, has told me have been, he sees lined up. So people right now are trying to get out of that area as well. So this completely is a situation where it is so dynamic at this hour that everywhere you look there are pockets of fire. To recap what we have learned from Captain Eric Scott, there is nothing at containment at this point because the fire is burning in so many different directions. They are calling for additional resources. They already have additional resources, so they are getting those as well. And at this point they are concerned about other areas that could burn at any point. And so as we continue to drive here on PCH, as we head back towards the Palisades, you can see fire burning right here. This is sunset and PCH. I'm going to go just a little farther west. Now. We've talked about that. The fire has spread east. This right here Scott Weber. Just pull show up a little bit here for me. Here you can see the fire burning on the hillside. So our photographer David Gregory has also just told me that there is a large home that is burning right on sunset. But here we are again, driving PCH. And just everywhere you look again, both sides fire, fire. Everywhere you look. I'm not sure what this is that we're seeing here, but again, we're not going to stop. We're not going to linger. But right here across the street, right here, a home on fire. And that is the situation that we look at as we come to a Porta Marina. And I'm going to turn here and give you a shot as we go back here. Sorry, I'm not a very good driver, Scott. I apologize right here. This is a home on the other side of PCH beachside, right here. A home. It says right here, Will Rogers. Oh, I apologize, Will Rogers State Beach. It is some type of structure. It looks like a, like operations port of operations, as Scott is telling me. Right there on fire. And then you have this home here on the other side that is burning. We can pop out here, Scott, for a second, because I see fire trucks surrounding us. So do you want to stay with me here so I can just give you a view here of what we're looking at again, PCH, both sides burning. I'm going to pop out with Scott Weber, our photographer. I was doing the driving and the wind continues to blow. And right here as we face the beach where it's safe, you can see that the fire here, it looks like it's destroyed at least one structure up there on the hillside. And what is important to note here is that you don't see a lot of fire engines, fire protection, structure protection. And again, that's only because there's only so much that they can do. And we're already talking about the additional resources that have been in place. So Scott was telling us this is the base of operations here at Will Rogers State Beach. They're just going to let this burn. This is not a home. But then you see homes right here, this is very close to the Getty Villa. And this is these are structures and parts of a home right here, right now that is up in flames. The wind keeps howling. The wind keeps going. And it doesn't matter what direction we've just traversed a significant portion of PCH with you all from Will Rogers State Beach. And now we are continuing to drive PCH. And this is what we're looking at right now. Both sides of the beach, fire structures on both sides of PCH destroyed. And as we are hearing again and it bears repeating, Mandeville Canyon now under evacuation. And we have a photographer in place that said, just as he was driving into Mandeville Canyon right there on sunset, a large home on fire. So when you talk about the number of structures, the number of homes lost, Colleen and Kathy as Captain Eric Scott with the LAFD said, that's not even something we can think about at this point. And when the light of day comes and then these winds die down, then they can start to look at that. But the most important thing that Eric Scott did tell us is that so far, no significant injuries reported when it comes to those trying to save homes and those trying to flee them. All right, Robert, thank you so much. The most important information there, and it bears repeating once again, Mandeville Canyon, from sunset to Mullholland. That's the new information he gave us that they are being evacuated right now. And this is the reason why. Think about how large an area that is. We're also getting word of mandatory evacuations issued because of the Eaton fire in Altadena. Let me just run these off for you very, very quickly. Altadena drive, Kinneloa Canyon Road, Outpost Lane, Glen Springs, Coolidge, Miranda, Roosevelt, veranda and Sinclair Drive. This is all according to the Angeles National Forest, folks. This this whole area is being evacuated because this fire has we use the term again exploded because of the winds out there to over 200 acres right now. Joining us on the phone, Roland Sprewell, who flies News Chopper 4 for us on a regular basis in the morning. He's on the phone. He's actually being evacuated from Altadena. Roland, we're so sorry, but can you tell us what's happening right now? Right now? Guys, I am sitting in a line of cars in a very dark Washington Avenue because most of the power has gone out in this particular area of Altadena and unincorporated Pasadena. And as soon as this, I got word of this fire because I started hearing a bunch of sirens driving past my house and just given what's been going on all day, I decided to poke my head out the door and look up and saw the entire canyon above me ablaze. Now I live south of New York, drive right off of the Altadena Drive area, and this what strikes me about this is it takes me back to the Eaton Canyon Fire of 1993, in which I was a young firefighter on that fire trying to protect homes in a cul de sac. And I never dreamed that one day that I would be on the receiving end of a major wildfire. Being a resident here and now being evacuated. Talk to us a little bit. Roland about the wind situation out there. The wind out here, Colleen is howling. I mean, it is howling. I mean, when I came home after my shift on News Chopper 4 earlier today, I found the outside of my home very disheveled, very just things thrown all over the place and stuff. I tried to pick things up. I knew that we had not yet seen the peak of these winds, so I was just trying to batten down the hatches, so to speak, and button everything up. And then just with the. And also I was watching a little bit of the coverage, watching you guys cover the fire in TV as well. And just within a couple of hours, the wind really, really picked up in this area. And then lo and behold, I heard the sirens and then saw that there was a brush fire indeed, in the canyon above me. We're talking a lot about a role in the fire support and whether we are seeing firefighters there. You know, as well as being a firefighter, are there enough resources there? We've watched this fire pretty much explode. That's a very good question. And from your lips to God's ears, I am praying that there are enough resources to get up there. I did see a couple of strike teams headed up Altadena Drive, but the way this fire is blowing, the winds, it has already blown south of New York Drive, I saw trees on fire. I don't know if there's any actual homes that are on fire south of New York Drive, but it's just too, too, too close for comfort. I certainly hope there's enough resources to get on this Roland knowing what you do every day, being up in the chopper, do you expect to see air support up there at any time this evening, or is it just too dangerous? And of course we have the TFR because the president is in town. Well, as I was packing, as I was packing my car and putting my important papers and everything inside, I did hear at least one helicopter overhead. I didn't have enough time to poke my head out the door to see whether or not they were doing actual water drops. I didn't hear or see any fixed wing or anything like that. Of course, it's nighttime and the winds are pretty significant to even try and bring in any sort of fixed wing aircraft into here. So this is this one here is going to be if it's going to be fought from the air, it's definitely going to be water dropping helicopters. Colleen. And what about extra support? I know the governor has declared a state of emergency, freeing up some funds from across the state. But will we see firefighters from across the nation coming here to try to help? Because this is going to go on now for more than 24 hours. It's only just starting. Yes, you quite possibly can see that. We've seen that on many a bad brush fire season throughout Southern California. We've seen firefighters come in from New Mexico, from Arizona, from Nevada and so forth. If that trigger has not been pulled, I'd really be surprised at this point. All right, Roland Sprewell, thank you and good luck, my friend. We hope you get out of there safely and we hope you make it through this one. Thank you. The fire. Take care on the phone with us as well. Connor Benavidez, who lives near the Eaton fire as well. Conner, where are you? Have you evacuated yet? Yeah, I evacuated, thankfully, but my God, we were. We were choking on smoke. We were. We were dodging embers. I just made it to a friend's house. Much, much south of south of the fire. But, yeah, I mean, we're still pretty shaken up here. And, Conner, were you at home at this time? And have have you been through anything like this or. I mean, I know we've put out our forecast. Were you surprised by this? How fast this erupted? Yeah. I mean, you guys said it best. It literally exploded. I mean, out of nowhere, we went to go take the dogs out, and then we saw a fire truck coming up our street and we thought, that's that's odd. And then we kind of noticed that it smelled like smoke. And we turned around and it was just an orange glow. And we were like, oh my, we have to go. We got to go. So we just we started packing and we, we, we, we had things prepared because, you know, just in case. And I'm so glad we did. But you know, it's, it's still crazy like having to, to pack up your home, you know. Connor, can you tell if this is burning away from your home or towards your home? And how close are you to the flames? We were. I mean, it was hot. We were choking on the smoke. The wind was was it was going both up and down the mountains. The glow was just getting brighter. It was. It was like. It looked like it was pretty much in the backyard. How close are you to Eaton Canyon, where the trails start? I mean, we are one house away from from the side of the canyon. Wow. That's really, really. You're very close to the fire. There are a lot of homes in that area. Right. And I would imagine. Definitely. And did you get everything you needed to get out of the house? All the important things. And you said you're at a friend's now, so. Yeah. We you know, my mom, myself, my brother, our dogs, our three dogs, we all got out. So, you know, at the end of the day, that's really all we need. But I mean, yeah, it was it was crazy. It was it was insane. I'm still in shock. Connor, are you still in the area? Are you able to watch what's going on? Oh, yeah. I mean, I can see the flames from here. Are you concerned you might have to leave that space as well? Are you still in the Altadena sort of Pasadena area? I am, I am in Pasadena still. Yes. And I am concerned about that. So we haven't unpacked anything that we that we packed up just in case we have to leave here. Boy, a lot of people like you tonight. Sleepless night, no doubt. Absolutely. Yeah. All right. Connor. Good luck to you. Thank you so much, I appreciate it. All right. We're going to check in with meteorologist Melissa Magee, who has been here throughout the day mapping this out. Melissa, how are we looking with the winds as we watch these two fires? Well, Kathy, we're just a couple of hours away from starting to see the peak intensity in terms of these winds getting stronger than where they currently are sitting in terms of miles per hour, I want to show you a live look outside as we're looking once again from our Mount Wilson camera. This is the Eaton fire there in Altadena. And you can see kind of hard to see because the sun is setting right now. We're fading into darkness, but the pillow tops and the smoke, the smoke plume is getting larger and larger. So this is a big concern as we go throughout the rest of tonight, I also want to show you what's going on as we take a look at the latest observation data in and around the Eaton fire. Here, La Cañada Flintridge. We've got winds gusting up to 23mph, gusts 29mph in Altadena and Sierra madre. We've got a gust coming in at about 34mph. Look at the wind direction here. If you see this circle and you see this area arrow, I should say out of the northeast, out of the northeast, out of the northeast. So these are these typical Santa Ana winds moving on through. They come through the mountains, the canyons and the passes all the way down to the coast and the Basin and working its way all the way down to our coastal spot. So not only do we have the Eaton fire, we also have this fire. We've been tracking all morning here in the Palisades. The Palisades fire here still with that northeasterly wind across areas in the Palisades gusting up to 28mph. Look at the Santa Monica mountains. The gusts now up to 75mph. So we're starting to see things strengthen and intensify in terms of the winds as we go throughout the rest of tonight, the overnight hours and into your Wednesday. And it's getting much stronger outside. Look at this in Lancaster. It was nowhere near this earlier today, and at 53mph we've got a gust for LAX. And at 43mph, so would not be surprised if we had some weather related travel delays. If there were some issues with turbulence. Because not only are we dealing with those strong winds at the surface, but well up in the upper levels of the atmosphere, that wind is even stronger, gusting right now in Santa Ana, up to 40mph. 10:00 tonight, when the thick of those winds will start to move on through, you can see we've got winds gusting close to 40mph in Malibu. But watch this color here. You can see the shading. That's an indication of winds in about 60mph to 70mph. Plus during the overnight hours. While a lot of us are sleeping, those winds are still coming in out of the north and east. And then once we get into 5 a.m, look at this close to 50mph for Malibu. Same thing in Hemet. So widespread damaging winds across much of our region. Let's talk about what's to come really over the next two hours when the peak intensity will arrive, and then over the next 12 to 24 hours, as we put this timeline together for you. Destructive Santa Ana winds will continue for the rest of tonight. The strongest, not even here yet. 10 p.m. To 5 a.m. On Wednesday. That's when these winds will reach anywhere from 60 to 70mph. A lot of spots. We've already seen that 65 to 80mph plus for some of our mountain communities. In terms of the impacts that we're seeing, school closures, especially if you're close to some of our evacuation locations, downed trees, power lines and likely some power outages because of not only do you have the Santa Ana's, but also extremely critical fire weather across much of our region. Wildfire smoke advisory has been posted because of the Palisades Fire from Santa Monica on west into Calabasas and Malibu. So if you don't have to be outside, just make sure you stay indoors. Close the windows. If you have to go outside, keep it brief and use the mask. These are destructive Santa Ana winds on the way, and they will likely get even stronger as we go throughout the rest of tonight. That's very latest. We'll track it throughout the night. I'll send it back over your way. Colleen and Kathy. All right, Melissa, thank you. And we are getting some new evacuation orders, mandatory evacuations. They are now spreading into the Santa area. This one goes from San Vicente up to 26th Street. Keep in mind, that's on top of the Mandeville Canyon that goes from sunset to Mullholland. So a wide swath of areas now being evacuated under mandatory evacuation orders. Let's check in with NBC 4's. Darsha Philips. She is live along sunset. Evacuation orders obviously in place there. What is the latest Darsha? Yeah, well, last time you checked in with me, this apartment complex behind me was pretty much engulfed in flames. Right now, it appears that fire crews have been able to put out most of the flames. As you can see it through the smoke, the very top floor of that apartment complex was engulfed and is pretty much damaged by flames that burned earlier. And then they were able to save the other floors below it. But this was an area where lots of responders came and concentrated their efforts. You can see the big engines here. They had their long ladders up and they were really pouring water onto this apartment complex. Just to give you an idea of where we are literally a stone's throw away from the town of Pacific Palisades, where you see all those restaurants and stores and shops. So of course, this is where they really want to stop that forward spread of the fire so it doesn't get into the town. Now we're going to walk over this way into the middle of the road, because fire crews are packing up here. Again, you can see this is the massive apartment complex that was evacuated and then caught fire. It appears the roof caught fire and then started to burn down. Which is why fire crews were attacking it from the top using their long ladders. And really dousing it with water to try and get those flames out. But you still see some orange glow in the windows there. So this is not completely out. And Kathy Colleen, I don't know if you can hear it, but we are still experiencing very strong winds. Just moments ago, I thought that there was a lull in the winds and we were going to get a bit of a reprieve, but then it started howling through here again. We're going to try and make our way down Sunset Boulevard, because really, this is where a lot of folks were stopped earlier. I did speak to a woman and her husband, an elderly couple who have lived here for about 20 years. They were trying to evacuate. They said that they left too late and they got stuck at the bottom of Sunset Boulevard. They weren't able to get through because this is the operation that is happening here right now. And one of the things that she said is that what's so difficult about this is that there are so many things that you have to overcome. You've got the wind, you've got the fire, then you've got all of the operations that are taking place right now that impede people from leaving. That's why it is so important that when you are told to evacuate, that you get out when you can because you do not want to get stuck in this. And the reason why folks cannot evacuate out down this way, past sunset, through Temescal Canyon and take it to PCH is because on Temescal Canyon, a bunch of power lines De-energized power lines came down the road and they really tangled up the road there. So folks cannot get through that way and head to PCH. So people who have not evacuated are really kind of trapped in this little triangle until the firefighters here complete what they have to do. But again, they're trying to make sure that this apartment complex doesn't continue to burn. They have been here for at least a couple of hours trying to get these flames out of this very large apartment complex. And earlier, just next to it is an assisted living building. It's a senior care memory care building. We were there when they were frantically evacuating their residents, and that was about 4:00 today. Fortunately, they got everyone out of there very quickly and safely. But again, this is such a dynamic situation. We're always coming on to things that are changing as we are going along. And again, Sunset Boulevard being shut down right here for folks who want to evacuate at this late hour are being stopped because of the operation we're seeing behind us. Colleen. Kathy. Thankfully, they got those people out. All right. Darsha, thank you so much. We'll check back with you in just a moment. We want to check in with meteorologist David Biggar, who is back, and we have the strongest winds ahead of us tonight. That's exactly right, Kathy. And one little note here before we get too deep into the forecast, just a reminder, we have a lot of evacuations that are expanding across the region. If you are told to evacuate, leave, do not stay behind trying to defend your house with a fire hose in a situation like this, considering how dry the air is and how hard the wind is blowing, that is going to have no effect on stopping the fire. And that's just going to risk your life. So just keep that in mind. If you are in any of the areas that are even adjacent to any of the evacuation areas, here's a look at satellite. This is a special kind of view. It's called fire temperature. So any time it detects heat from satellite, it colors in a pixel. And the brighter that pixel is, the more intense that fire is burning. This has been burning very intensely around Pacific Palisades, but you can see how that fire near the Eden Canyon area just suddenly popped onto our map only about an hour ago, and so we've been keeping track of that as well. So we're going to start off there, and then we'll move to the Pacific Palisades area and tell you about the conditions around that fire right now around the Eden fire. We've got wind conditions at about the 10 to 20 mile per hour range, but we are starting to see some of the gusts pick up. You can see Sierra madre, for example, winds in the 34 mile per hour range, or gusts in the 34 mile per hour range. La Cañada Flintridge gusting about 30 to 35 miles an hour, and around Altadena, we've had gusts in about the 20 to 30 mile per hour range. One note with this, look at all these wind directions. They're all out of the north and the northeast. That means that any embers, any smoke from this is being blown down into the Pasadena area, down into the San Gabriel Valley. So if you are maybe around Pasadena, you smell smoke. This is the reason why you're likely smelling some of that smoke. The smoke is being essentially pushed directly down into the valley. Hasn't even had a chance to rise. The winds are so strong right now. All right. Pacific Palisades, around the Palisades fire. Look at this observation site around one of our ridge tops. Sustained winds of 65 miles an hour with gusts up to 75 miles an hour. So this is what we've been concerned about is some of the wind speeds starting to approach that 70 to 80 mile per hour range, Topanga Beach. We've got wind gusts in the 35 to 40 mile per hour range. And right now around Pacific Palisades, about 20 to 30 mile per hour wind gusts. But you can see that the fire has been expanding a couple different directions here. Even the winds are generally out of the north and the northeast. Keep in mind, we have a lot of canyons that run through the Santa Monica mountains. Most of those are north to south, but they do kind of take a couple of doglegs. You can see one right here that exits around the Pacific Palisades area, and that is potentially leading to some erratic winds and some gusty winds, because you can get a channeling effect through some of these valleys and canyons. And that's what we might be seeing around some areas of the Palisades Fire. Now, before we get into futurecast, I just wanted to remind you of the wind color scale that we use on all of our maps. We are really sitting in this range right now, with occasional gusts up above 60 miles an hour, so tree damage is likely over the next couple of hours. Trees being uprooted is what we're expecting as we go into the overnight hours tonight, and the gusts really start to ramp up. This is 1:00 in the morning. Look at some of these gusts around parts of the San Fernando Valley. Burbank gusting above 50 miles an hour. We're already seeing that right now in some spots. Porter Ranch gusting above 40 miles an hour. And then you can see that this wind speed just continues all the way through the morning hours. This is 7:00 in the morning. We still have gusts extending all the way out to the Ventura County coastline for the San Gabriel Valley. It's very similar. By 9:00 this evening, we're starting to see some very strong gusts. This red color that's near the Eden Canyon area. And that corresponds to 60 to 70 mile per hour gusts. San Antonio Heights, 60 to 70 mile per hour gusts. So a lot of our foothill communities will be looking at some very strong winds as we get closer to midnight. And that will linger all the way into the morning hours. So by 5:00 in the morning, the wind intensity has come down a touch. But we're still looking at gusts and some of our foothill communities, and that 40 to 50 mile per hour range. That's latest on the conditions. I'll send it back to you. All right, David, thank you for that. Breaking news right now at 8:00, two fires burning in our area. That's right. The Palisades fire and the Eaton fire. The close fire that is burning right now in Altadena. NBC 4 news starts with breaking news. And it is 8:00. And we are following breaking news continuously. The Palisades fire has burned nearly 3000 acres. We have seen several homes destroyed. At least a dozen. The fire is being fueled by those strong, erratic winds. They are only going to get stronger tonight. There is an evacuation shelter that has been set up at Westwood Recreation Center, and the location of that is one, 350 South Sepulveda Boulevard. New information here at 8:00. An evacuation order is now also in place for the city of Santa Monica. That order is for all areas of that city north of San Vicente. This, according to the city's website, there is no immediate threat to life. We are also tracking that Eaton fire that exploded in Altadena. We have watched that. It's now grown to at least 200 acres in just 30 minutes. We were looking at pictures of that, the huge plume. We know people are being evacuated. It's impacting areas of Altadena Drive, Kanaloa Canyon Road, Glen Springs and Sinclair Drive. Okay. We want to bring in now meteorologist Melissa Magee who is tracking the winds. And of course we're not going to talk about the peaks of the winds here right now. Melissa. Yeah. Michael and Kathy, just a couple of hours away from finding the peak intensity with the winds. And once those winds strengthen, they will continue during the overnight hours into our Wednesday morning. So I want to show you the very latest in terms of our live pictures. We're looking from our Mount Wilson camera. It's pointed toward the east and the Eaton fire. Right now you can see large plumes of smoke up in the air. And this is an issue because it's starting to grow in size. I want to show you what we're starting to see across that region in terms of the observation data. Sierra madre. We've got winds gusting up to 34mph. Gusts in Altadena, up to 30 32mph in La Cañada Flintridge, and the winds are stiff and strictly out of the northeast, out of the northeast and out of the northeast. There, in La Cañada Flintridge, relative humidity dropping down into the lower 20s. So you have those Santa Ana winds coming through the mountains, the canyons and passes, and it dries out, the atmosphere also drying out the relative humidity, which will elevate our fire concern all the way down to the coast. Not only are we tracking the Eaton fire, but we also have the Palisades fire here. And look at this in the Santa Monica mountains. It's already starting for you. When we were on the air earlier today, we had winds for the mountains anywhere from 50 to 60mph. Look at this. Right now we've got a sustained wind straight out of the north at 65mph. And then the gust is up to 85mph. That's why the Santa Ana winds are significant. That's why the National Weather Service has been using language like life threatening, destructive and damaging. This is a particularly dangerous situation for much of Southern California, and everybody is getting in on the winds right now. Look at this. 53mph in Van Nuys, Santa Clarita, and at 45mph, close to 60 there. In Ontario, a lot of the concentration with the heaviest winds have been for the majority of the day out across LA and Ventura counties. Now that wind is starting to push across areas in Orange County and the Inland Empire as we go throughout the rest of tonight. Speaking of tonight, we'll give you a timeline and take you into time here. 10 p.m. When the height of the winds start to arrive across our region, we've got winds gusting up to 40mph in San Bernardino. I don't want you to really focus in on these numbers, but really, the colors here and the darker the color, the more intense the wind. We're starting to see these winds for the San Gabriel Mountains up across San Bernardino and Riverside counties, gusting anywhere from 50 to 70mph or higher. And we've already seen some of these gusts earlier today. And then as we get into tomorrow morning, we've got more of the same in terms of our issues here. So let's talk about what's to come over the next 12 to 24 hours. More of these destructive Santa Ana winds, the strongest winds, the peak later on tonight in a couple of hours from 10 p.m. During the overnight hours into 5 a.m. On Wednesday after 5 a.m, the winds will still be fairly strong, but the most intense time period will be later on tonight into tomorrow morning. So what does that mean for you in terms of the impacts school closures, especially close to some of our evacuation sites, downed trees, downed power lines and power outages as well. And because these are such strong Santa Ana winds currently moving on through extremely critical fire weather as well, because the relative humidity is dropping, that Santa Ana wind dries dries out the atmosphere all the way down to the surface. So that's a big concern. Even after the height of the winds move on out later tomorrow morning, we're still going to have an issue with the red flag warning. It's been incredibly dry for at least six months here in Southern California and no rain is coming. So Santa Ana is the big concern. That's the very latest. We'll track it throughout the night. I'll send it back over your way. One question before you go, Melissa. These this extreme fire weather we are seeing, this is the third time now recently we have seen these conditions. That's right Kathy. So the National Weather Service has issued a particularly dangerous situation or a PDS for short. This is the third time they've issued it this season. The first time was in November. The last time was in December, very close to when we were tracking the mountain fire and the Franklin Fire. But this event is even more significant than those two because of how long these winds will be around and the strength of the winds all the way down to the coast. So typically for LAX, for the Basin, we don't see these winds getting this strong, but we're still calling for winds anywhere from 60 to 75, 70mph. That's one reason why, for the mountains, you've got winds anywhere from 65 to 85mph. So it has to do with the strength of the wind, the intensity of the wind, and the length of finding winds. Here in Southern California, this is a long duration event. It's not just lasting. Tonight we have to track this still, even as we get into our Wednesday morning. All right Melissa we appreciate that. So we told you earlier about the evacuation order now in place for certain parts of the city of Santa Monica. We want to bring in now the former mayor of Santa Monica, Phil Brock. Phil, are you with us? Yes, I am all right. So talk about what you're seeing here right now. And there was some pretty strong language in this press release, according to the website, that this is an immediate threat to life. Yes. There is a concern that the fire could jump from the Palisades through Rustic Canyon, through Santa Monica Canyon, and up to the hill. We've had a great view of the fire. Unfortunately, on Apalachee, which is just north of San Vicente, there is a worry that with these winds that the fire department's combined departments would not be able to protect life in Rustic Canyon and Santa Monica Canyon. And are concerned it could jump into what we call the mainland of Santa Monica. So I live actually across the street from the evacuation order on San Vincente, and I urge everyone on la mesa, on Adelaide, on all of our streets north of San Vincente, to take immediate heed. And it would be better to spend the night in your car or at a shelter than stay on San Vincente and risk destruction to your house, property, and possibly yourself. In addition, from Montana Avenue north to the city limit, Santa Monica Fire Department is advising everyone to prepare to possibly be evacuated. So this is an extremely serious situation. I can tell you. I will tell you, I just had a birthday. I'm 71. I have never, never seen fire like this in the Palisades. Reaching into the main part of the Palisades and reaching the beach of this area. Besides where it has traveled. And happy birthday! We're sorry you're spending the after your birthday doing this, but we're glad you're safe. Have you ever seen a fire behave like this? I mean, what's the closest you've come? It's so erratic. It's spreading so quickly. So many evacuations. You know, in high school, 1970, Sam Ojai. And there was no Malibu High. And I ended up on the beaches of Malibu, helping evacuate animals and people on the beach. That may have been the worst conflagration I had ever seen. With uncertainty about where the fire would hit next. This is similar. We have no idea where the fire is going because the winds keep shifting. You know, Phil, this was a fire that was first reported at 1030 this morning. It was a ten acre fire. Now we're well above 2900 acres to see what has happened over the course of 7 to 8 hours. What goes through your mind? Terror. For many of the people who live in the Palisades, I've spent time in the Palisades all my life. And to hear that the women's club, for instance, has been destroyed. It's been there since the 1920s. You know, to see, I have friends in service clubs and nonprofits who live in the Palisades, who are evacuating right now. It's tragic and it's sad. Have you heard anything about the Getty Villa? I know they were trying to protect it and protect all of the artifacts and the artwork inside. I forget my understanding is the museum pieces are safe, the grounds are cinched. Same at Palisades High School. I understand the athletic fields have gone up in flames, the football field. But I understand that the buildings, most of them or all of them are still standing. It's unheard of in an area that even though we border the wildlands, if you will, and I hike in Santa Monica mountain on those trails all the time. But to think that a fire could come into civilization in this manner, in an area that I've lived in all my life, is absolutely unheard of. All right. The former mayor of Santa Monica, Philbrook, we appreciate your time here this afternoon. And all right, this evening, I should say, and please remain safe. Prayers for everyone. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you. NBC 4's Robert Kovacik has been out covering the Palisades Fire. He's been along Sunset Boulevard letting us know that Mandeville Canyon from sunset to Mullholland actually was evacuated. And he's been driving through the area, giving us a live look at exactly what's happening, showing us places that are on fire. Just wondered, Robert, can you hear us now? You've been driving down sunset. Where are you now? Well, you know what? We were on PCH and we were towards Santa Monica. Fire burning on both sides of PCH. Now we were trying to make our way back towards Mandeville Canyon under evacuation. Like much of Brentwood. And this is the intersection of Sunset and Amalfi. Absolutely beautiful area here in Los Angeles now being threatened. What you hear are sirens of LAPD officers that are going up and down streets telling people that it's time to get out. And as we cross the street there, you can see the LAPD right there at just up here on Amalfi, asking people, telling people it is now time to leave. And then you wonder, well, where is this fire right now? Well, it is still it is still threatening the Palisades. And as it continues to threaten the Palisades, thank you so much. And take out much of the Palisades. Thank you. Gentlemen, LAPD just handed me my hat because once again, it was falling off. Scott, come pull over here for a second. Be careful of the intersection. We're in the crosswalk at sunset and Amalfi. This is what they have blocked off to traffic. And you can see the fire still raging here in the Palisades. It continues to burn another home. It looks like up there on that ridge is lost. So what we have seen since we have left PCH, since we have left a command post with so many fire trucks and manpower, they're trying to figure out what angle, where they can hit this fire next, where this fire will go next. It keeps changing its mind right now. It continues now to push west where we watched it push east with these tremendous gusts of wind. So sunset in Amalfi right now under evacuation fears that the fire is coming this way, fears that these homes are in danger. And we have seen a number of residents who have not left get ready to leave. But it is coming. It is roaring right now. You are looking at sunset and this is sunset heading east. It is roaring sunset right now and again pushing itself this way to where we are at the intersection of Amalfi. We we've talked about the evacuations that are going on in Santa Monica. We are talking about the evacuations that are happening right now in Brentwood. You were talking to Phil Brock, worked with Phil for many years. And you know what? He is truly not exaggerating. He never does. This is a very in an event that is jaw dropping in its scope, in its nature and its in its intensity. The fact that we have been warned by our meteorologists throughout the last 48 hours that the winds were only going to pick up, that has proven to be the case. So from this morning, and now as we head into the evening hours, the flames only intensify because the wind keeps pushing them. And what is even more terrifying, we just don't know what direction it is going to head next. Again, we've covered a lot of ground with you in the past few hours, and in this ground that we have covered, everywhere you turn, we see fire, everywhere we look, we see structures on fire. Sometimes we see homes on fire, but there is nothing they can do in terms of getting there on time. Because either the flames have been pushed by embers or there is simply just not enough fire power to be able to hit them. But we do have the best firefighters in the world that are here. They're getting additional resources and they are prepared, they say, for where this fire hits next. But you know what? When you talk about we don't have a number of how many homes have been destroyed. We certainly don't have a number of what possibly they can do to contain this, because I don't even know where the containment lines begin or where they stand right now. What sparked this fire also will be under investigation, but it just continues to rage as we have another area being now forced out of their homes. These are people that have been told to evacuate before, but now they are doing a street by street. Please, please get out now. Can't imagine that based on what has happened thus far since 1030 this morning, that there would be anybody still in their homes after all of the destruction, all the devastation and the rapid fire growth here. And you know what's what. You know what's weird about that, Michael, is that you can truly, at this point, go just a block or a short period or a short little period away. And the sky is clear, the streets are clear. Even driving Amalfi from the coast, there was nothing but beautiful homes and blue sky and Christmas and holiday lights still up on these homes. And we're like, it looks like a break. But that's that break is going to change because the fire is right now moving in that very direction. It is getting once again very dark. It is getting very hard to see. The skies here are filling with smoke. Skies have just minutes ago were completely clear. So to answer your question, you think you're okay? You think you're out of the woods? You think the fire has passed you, as we've seen with so many other fires, it's like, okay, it's moved. It's moved past us. We're in the clear right now. No place is in the clear because again, this fire can switch directions as we are witnessing at any moment. And the thing is, to Robert, you were talking to Captain Eric Scott earlier. They have got firefighters now who have been on the clock. Now they are going to work around the clock and they need resources. They need people to come in and relieve them. Are they going to have that? And they they not only need resources, but but I hear from our viewers in other areas, you know, what's going to happen if the fire jumps the 405? What's going to happen in in the Hollywood Hills this evening? What's going to happen elsewhere? There are so many vulnerable sections of Los Angeles. We have so many hilly regions. We have so many areas that, thanks to the rains of last year, have been covered in thick vegetation and growth. So we have wildfires that have nothing but fuel to burn once they get started. Scott's pushing me over here for a minute and yeah, you. So you see right here, this is what I want you to witness. If you see this, everybody please pay attention. Let's just be quiet for a minute. We'll see. We watch these guys as they go through. So this is what this is what we are witnessing throughout much of Los Angeles. And now, of course, in Altadena. And with these winds, who knows where else in Southern California and in our area, as you look right now, these are we have seen LAPD officers look, they're just going up and down the street asking people to please get out and to heed their advice. And it looks like we have someone who is doing just that, a woman in a car that's leaving. But you see one after the other. They're going down these streets and this area again right here. Sunset and Amalfi. People being told, don't wait, it's time to go. We now want to switch gears and head on over to NBC 4's Darsha Philips along Temescal Canyon. Darsha. Yeah, we're right here by Palisades Theater. And when we saw here last night, it was just engulfed in flames. And now you can see it's just a skeleton of what it once was. That entire building collapsed. We were here when there was a partial roof collapse. And now it appears that the entire roof is gone. It's just the shell of the building. This is the Palisades Theater on Temescal Canyon. Now, we have seen firefighters pouring water on what's left of this, because when these winds kick up, these embers go and start to fly, like about two miles ahead of this. And we're starting to feel again, these very strong winds that are coming through Temescal Canyon. Now, I also want to show you just over to my left, what you're seeing is the high school Pali High, home of the dolphins. Here we do see fire crews in there trying to do some structure protection of the main buildings. We did see athletic buildings on the baseball field and the football field go up in flames. But this is our first look at Pali High at Palisades High. Of the main buildings that appear to be intact. We do see a lot of water on the ground. So it appears that fire crews were here earlier trying to protect the school and the structures. Now, I do want to show you just down the street, you see that orange glow with all the smoke that is Haverford Drive. That is an area that is just filled with homes. And we have been watching that glow just get bigger and bigger. We've seen active flames. We have also seen fire crews go over there trying to assess the situation. But again, this is something that is changing as the night goes on. These winds continue to be strong. We are also seeing this is what I'm talking about with the embers here on Palisades Theater. You can see the winds pick up and those embers just blow and they catch these little spot fires that really become troublesome because they ignite. We haven't had significant rain in our area for months, for about eight months. So all of this vegetation, all of this brush is extremely dry. It doesn't take much for it to ignite and then continue with these winds. It is like a blowtorch. I've said it before and I've covered fires here in California for many, many years. These winds are some of the strongest winds I have ever felt. And when we talk about the evacuations and the people who tried to stay, I spoke with an elderly couple who were just evacuating about an hour ago. It was really unbelievable. When I asked her, she thought that that it would pass, that it would pass through her house, and that she had lived through other fires. And then they ended up leaving, apparently too late. They did get trapped here for a little bit, but they were able to make it out. But these are the stories that we're hearing. Robert mentioned it. We've been mentioning it throughout our entire broadcast. When you're told to leave, just take your stuff and go, because it really isn't ideal to be stuck in thes, in this condition, in these situations, without being able to leave. And when you have fire, that's this dynamic and this unpredictable, you want to be able to get out as quickly as possible. Now, we have seen fire crews in this area more so than we did earlier. So I think they're concentrating on trying to put out a lot of these flames. As these winds continue to pick up and push these flames elsewhere. We were also on Radcliff Drive earlier. We're showing you right now. Take a look at that. That is the dry brush I'm talking about parched vegetation. That is all around the Pacific Palisades and all around Southern California. Again, we haven't had any rain, so it doesn't take much for something to ignite. Now. We were also on Radcliff. We saw several homes burning there, and we tried to get down through Temescal Canyon again. You can see that orange glow on Haverford Drive where there are many homes as well. We tried to get down there, but the smoke was so thick we could not see feet in front of us. That is how fast and thick and hard this fire is burning. It's burning through a lot of brush that's creating that very dark, thick smoke. So unfortunately, right now we are still in such a precarious situation here in the Pacific Palisades. Things are still burning out of control. As you can see, homes are being damaged and burned as we speak right now. We do see more first responders trying to navigate through Temescal Canyon. And it is difficult. You see how slow they're going. It's actually because when Pacific Palisades theater burned and the roof collapsed, it took down several power lines. So they're moving slowly because those power lines, they are de-energized. But of course, they don't want to get tangled into them. So they are moving very slowly through Temescal Canyon. Again, so many obstacles that folks who remained and of course, first responders have to navigate. And Michael, you just heard it through my microphone. I'm sure you're hearing it. Is this wind keeps howling. I have to hold on to my hat because it is very difficult sometimes to even stand when these strong gusts come through the canyon. We'll send it back to you guys. All right. Darsha, thank you so much. We're going to check in with meteorologist David Biggar. He can prepare us now for the hours that we have ahead. Yeah, it's it feels almost hard to say this guys. But it's almost 830 and we still haven't had the peak of the winds yet. It's still coming. And unfortunately we still have two now large fires burning in the area. So this is the view from satellite. Again this is what we call fire temperature. So the brighter the pixels are on this map that means the more intense the fire is burning. You see it still burning very intensely around Pacific Palisades. And here's the fire that popped up around the Eden Canyon area, just starting to kind of develop on our maps. Let's start off with the areas around the Pacific Palisades, because I wanted you to see some of the wind speeds that we're starting to get. The Santa Monica mountains Ridge top sites are now reporting wind gusts in the 75 to 85 mile per hour range, currently gusting at 83 miles an hour with sustained winds at 61 miles an hour. Would not be surprised if we start getting some reports of trees coming down in a couple of these areas around Topanga Beach, we've got wind gusts around 32 miles an hour, with a sustained wind of 14 miles an hour, and around Pacific Palisades. We're looking right now at gusts of about 26 miles an hour. But notice the wind directions have been shifting around a bit. It's partially because we have a lot of north south canyons, but they're not perfectly north south. They all kind of bend a little bit. You can kind of track some of these if you look very closely at the map here, but that will lead to some channeling and sometimes intensification of the winds in a few areas. It's what we call the Venturi effect, where you start blowing a wind into a constricted area. It actually accelerates through the constriction before coming out the other side. So we sometimes get that in the canyons. So we'll be watching that very closely. I wanted to show you what the fire is looking like. This is the Eden fire. So this is from our Mount Wilson camera. One additional note on here we have seen occasional flashes from our Mount Wilson shot down just below the fire. You can also see a lot of darkness. We're likely getting a lot of power lines coming down in a few spots, so we're keeping an eye on that too. But this is what the fire looks like from our Mount Wilson camera. Currently around the fire, we are starting to see some pretty impressive gusts. You can see Eden Canyon Park, so not in the canyon itself, but more down toward the flat area before you get into the trailhead. That's where you're looking at wind gusts, potentially of 41 miles an hour right now, with sustained winds at about 19 miles an hour in Altadena, Sierra madre. We're looking at wind gusts in about the 30 to 35 mile per hour range. And La Cañada Flintridge is now reporting gusts at nearly 50 miles an hour. So this is sort of what we're seeing across the entire region, taking a wide view, you can see how much of this map is purple or pink or maybe even red. That's an indication. If you look at our little wind scale here, we always have this up on the side for Futurecast or any of our wind maps. That's 40 to 50 mile per hour gusts or 50 to 60 mile per hour gusts, depending on which color you're seeing. So around Van Nuys right now, we're seeing 53 mile per hour gusts, very similar at Burbank Airport. In fact, Burbank Airport likely starting to see gusts higher than that because we're starting to get this red coming off of the Verdugo Mountains right now around LAX, which is typically wind shelter during a Santa Ana wind 40 mile per hour gusts. Very similar for Long Beach typically wind shelter during a Santa Ana wind 36 mile per hour gusts. As you take a look toward the Inland Empire just south of the eye of the Cajon Pass, through what we always kind of call the IE Wind Tunnel, we're looking at nearly 60 mile per hour gusts for Ontario, likely seeing gusts above 60 miles an hour through areas like Fontana and Rialto right now. And we are looking at gusts around 60 miles an hour right around Thousand Oaks, right about where the edge of this is. So it's really all flowing out of the northeast, right off the coastline. We're getting that across Orange County as well. Now we have kind of because we've been focusing so much on the fires, we haven't had a chance to talk about the winds for the IE and Orange County tonight. It's very similar to the rest of the region. 9 p.m. Very gusty south of Cajon Pass. Here's that wind tunnel we were just talking about. Jurupa Valley also going to see some of this wind and look at some of the winds around Orange County, especially as we get into the overnight. Coto de Caza, looking at windsbout 60 miles an hour, or at least gusts up to 60 miles an hour south of Cone Pass. Plenty of areas looking at gusts above 50 miles an hour. And it's not until we get later in the day. On Wednesday, we start to get some relief because by noon it is still gusting up above 40 miles an hour across a good portion of the Inland Empire. Again, here's what the afternoon looks or the evening looks like. 7 p.m. The wind intensity has come down, but still we've got gusts above 20 miles an hour through many areas of the IE. So we're continuing to monitor this obviously, as we go through the next couple of days. A quick little look at the forecast there for a second. But yeah, so we're going to continue to monitor this. Our concern is that as we go through the next couple of hours, with wind speeds starting to exceed 50 miles an hour, wind gusts above 50 miles an hour, we might start to see a couple of trees come down across the region. David, we talked about the acreage now on the Eaton fire, and that is now up to 400 acres again. I think when we first started, it was about 200 or so. So you talk about the characteristics of this particular fire and what's expected in that area over the next couple of hours. Well, it's so it's very similar to what we've seen with the Pacific Palisades fire. So we're getting a lot of embers getting kicked up by it. You've got some strong winds around the area. Again. We've seen gusts up to nearly 40 miles an hour near the flat areas at the trail entrance for Eden Canyon. It doesn't take much. It takes a single ember to go start a spot fire somewhere. And with Pacific Palisades tonight, we've had embers by the hundreds being blown out of trees, shrubs, homes even, and they get carried for thousands of feet, if not miles, because of how gusty the winds are. So that's our concern for tonight. And that is an obvious connection to why this fire started at 20 acres. There was 200 and is now 400. Would not be surprised if we get more rapid growth as we go through the overnight with some of these gusty winds. Yeah, it's so surprising how quickly people have had to evacuate. But you talk about how they die down, but then they can pick up in a moment's notice. Well, it was interesting. This afternoon we almost had like this fake lull. We knew that we would have a little break, so to speak, because we were still seeing gusts above 30 miles an hour in spots. But the overall intensity came down a bit, but we knew it was going to ramp back up, and I think that may have caught some people by surprise. But a little reminder for any areas adjacent to any of the fires, we're talking about the Eden fire as well as the Palisades Fire. Since the evacuation areas around the Palisades fire keep growing. If you're anywhere near these fires, as soon as officials tell you to leave, leave. If you are anywhere near where the evacuations are, start prepping your go bag. That's your documents, your medication, all the important things you need to take with you. Because again, as soon as they tell you to leave, leave. Everything is moving very quickly tonight and do not attempt to fight this with a hose. It's not going to work. Everything is evaporating very quickly. So obviously the fires are spreading quick. All right. David Biggar, meteorologist David Biggar we'll be back with you in just a second. But it's now 830 and we are following two fires burning in our area. We are the ones you just saw. This is the one in Pacific Palisades we've been following since this morning when it sparked. But we also have this one that popped up now in Altadena. This is the close fire that is burning in Eaton Canyon or near Eaton Canyon. We can tell you that the Palisades Fire has burned about 3000 acres, and there are evacuation orders for parts of Santa Monica, though that is new information. The order is for all areas north of San Vicente. At least 10,000 homes threatened by the flames, maybe more by now. And 30,000 people at last count. But it could be more ordered to evacuate. Also, this just in Malibu. Schools are closed for tomorrow. Also in Altadena, the Eaton fire has now grown, as we just mentioned, to 400 acres. Evacuation orders are also in place. Obviously it's impacting areas of Altadena, dry Kanaloa, Canyon Road, Glen Springs and Sinclair Drive, all Pasadena Unified schools are closed on the phone right now. Lisa Derderian, she is with the police and fire in Pasadena. Lisa, if you can hear us, can you update us right now on the Altadena fire? Sure. We have mandatory evacuations. We're working on setting up mass care and sheltering. We need the staff and the logistical support, so we will be putting it out to the media and our cit. Pasadena, Canett website as soon as we get that up and running. We're in unified command with passing a fire. The Forest Service and L.A. County fire well over 200 acres and growing at a rapid rate. Aircraft has been grounded due to the wind, and structures are threatened as as you've been showing. So not a good scenario, especially with the winds expected to get worse before they get better. So we really need people to evacuate. If they received our reverse 911 call to get out of the area, because we've seen all day what has been happening in the Palisades, and we need to keep our community safe. Okay, Lisa, if we can just put you on hold here for one quick second, we want to go out to our Macy Jenkins, who is live in Altadena right now. Macy we are seeing some pretty extreme pictures here. Michael. The wind has picked up so significantly it's getting hard to stand. I'm going to give you an idea of where we are on Washington Boulevard. We are near a nursing home. The park. Excuse me. The Park View nursing home, wellness center, and they are evacuating patients in wheelchairs as you see embers flying through the wind. They're trying to get the cars out of the street. That's what I just heard police saying. They're trying to get the cars out of the street and the parking lot so they can get these patients into a safe location. Now, there are a few ambulances, but there's still traffic coming this way. I'm looking over here and I'm seeing that. I'm seeing that they're using. Oh, I see they're using a small truck to get some of these people out of the way. It's getting harder and harder to see here and very, very smelling like smoke. I want to get out of the way and let my photographer, Susan Monroe, get some of these people. Obviously, they had no time to prepare before they had to get out. As these embers are flying and the ambulances are coming here, there are certain there are certain. Excuse me. For first responders, I'm trying to get a look on the other side of the street. It looks like there are several police officers and also ambulances trying to evacuate these people. Again, we're here on Washington Boulevard at the Pasadena Park Health Care and Wellness Center. Some of these patients appear to be they're in very severe condition. Another person, he was screaming that he couldn't breathe. It's hard for us to breathe. And we are standing and walking here. The lights on the street have have gone out. Looks like the street lights are out. And it is. I cannot even see the wellness center from across the street. That is how thick the smoke is right here. You know, it's very hard to say. I was I was listening to Darsha Philips and she says she has covered many fires in California, as have I. But when things move this quickly and the embers fly, you do not have a moment's notice. You have maybe minutes seconds to get your things and get out again. If you pan this way, you'll see pillows on the streets as they're trying to get these patients here. The, the, the first responders trying to again clear the streets, the busses in front of us, out of service, very chaotic here in Altadena. We know we want to stay on the patients as much as possible to see what's happening, but this is a tedious situation because this looks like it is a skilled nursing facility of some sort, as you said, a wellness center. And these are people who need care. And so to get them out of harm's way and get them on the busses, but still tend to their medical needs, my gosh, you have to feel for these people who are assisting here. It is just a very difficult situation and you can see many of them have oxygen tanks that they are just holding on to. They're strapped to the wheelchairs. Some people have their items in bags. They're being assisted by the people who are here. Some of the people working with the health care center, others look like they're in plain clothes. So possibly family members. And I'm trying to get out of the street so we can see really what is happening over here. McDonald's parking lot now taken over by cars and first responders trying to get in to this area. But again if you you'll see the people on stretchers and just the effort the very rapid effort to try to get these people out of harm's way as we now see. I mean, I'm looking I can see some lights at the wellness center, but truthfully, it is black and windy out, hard for us to see. And we are wearing goggles. I can't imagine what it's like for some of these patients who cannot breathe. And some of these first responders who are actually running back and forth across the street. One of the officers told me, I overheard him saying, they're trying to get them as far away from the hospital as they can, but truthfully, you can't. You can only go a few blocks before you excuse me. Run into more parking lots that are. Oh, look, let's take a look here. So it looks like we have a city bus, a Pasadena Transit bus that is going to be help. That is going to help evacuate some of these patients. Are you getting ready to put patients onto this bus, sir? Sir, are you going to be putting patients on? Are they going to be using this? Okay. That that's a very good use of city transit here. So there is a little bit of traffic on this side. It might be people who are local who live over here. But again many of the street lights are out. You can see blinking lights in the distance. But as we were coming towards this area, the street lights are out. So you really have to tread carefully. We're going to go closer to this area. Macy back to the parking lot here. Macy as you make that walk. Any idea and just give us a rough estimate if you can. How many patients have you seen being removed from that facility? I'm going to say I've seen at least 40 patients. Wow. And they just keep coming. My goodness, it's quite it's quite a lot. And I'm I imagine that if someone has a family member here, these people in plain clothes, they've likely rushed over here to try to get their family members out of harm's way. And we can see and the pictures that we're seeing, very few of them are walking out standing up. A lot of them are being wheeled out in wheelchairs. Some of them are being assisted by, you know. Administrators with that wellness center to get to that bus or to that ambulance. So a lot of these folks obviously need assistance. You can see this person in a wheelchair with no shoes on the blanket, just dragging in the street. And those gusts of winds keep hitting us. And I can imagine they're hitting the patients as well. Very difficult to breathe and really open your eyes. Yeah. That's so hard on them. And it's also very scary. It's scary for anyone who's out in the middle of this. I can't imagine what their family members must be thinking if they are watching or hearing about this. But thank goodness, as you said, people are there assisting them to see that city bus. It just gives you some hope that they're going to be able to get all the people out and hopefully away from the fire. But I wanted to ask you, how close are you to actual flames right now? I know the smoke is bad, but how close is the fire? You know? Kathy, if I can, I'm looking at the facility now. I do not see flames, but I see lights. I thought it was an orange glow. I think those are police lights. It is too. The smoke is too thick for us to actually see the flames. And I am struggling myself because the wind is blowing so quickly. Blowing off this. This mask I'm wearing here. But really, I cannot see past the lights, so I can't see a block in front of me. I will, I will say that I do not see active flames. I see smoke, thick smoke in front of me. All around us we've seen embers, the embers have slowed down. I saw, oh, I see, I see a few of them in the air. So obviously there is fire coming from just north of us where the mountains are. Yeah. Could you imagine? Obviously you have the, the, the environmental elements. You have the fire, you have that smoke in the area. And these patients who need assistance to get to where they're going. As we give you that live picture there on on the right there, you see some folks with that wellness center, you know, leaving the scene. But we saw them earlier here tonight. You know, carting some of those patients out. Yeah. And we can plan for this. We know we hear the weather reports. We know the winds are coming, but in a way, you can't plan for something like this happening having to evacuate because we just don't know where the fires are going to pop up. And we were covering Palisades. All of a sudden we got word, oh, there might be something happening in Altadena. Oh, there is a small fire and suddenly it has erupted into this, and it has only been a matter of a couple of hours. The interesting thing about to note about these fires is that there's no start and finish lines to any of them. These firefighters have their, you know, heads on a swivel because, you know, right. When you think you're handling one part, you know, you've got three other spot fires, you know, popping up around. And again now we have the evacuation order in parts of the city of Santa Monica. Now when we talk about the Palisades fire. So again, what we're looking at here is the, the, the Eaton fire. Now up to 400 acres. And we see evacuations here. This Pasadena Park Health and Wellness Center on Washington Boulevard now being evacuated with those patients. I can't even imagine what it takes to try to coordinate this with the patients that need critical care, the patients who have to be carried out on a stretcher Macy the winds just look so incredible. We can hear them. We see how you're struggling. It seems like they're not letting down at all. Show you before we probably have to move. Just this area right here in front of the wellness center. There were firefighters trying to wet it. He screamed out, we've got to get wet. This area here, because there are now embers coming down there on the ground and the wind is getting stronger and stronger. You can see the if you look at those embers over there. Susan Rubio Rossmoor photographer here, you can see them on the ground as they are flying, and they're moving the cars out of this area. I'll send it back to you guys. All right? Yeah. Macy again, so many elements to what is happening with this particular scene here. Much of what we've seen in the Palisades over the course of the last, you know, 7 or 8 hours here. We want to bring in a meteorologist David Biggar right now, obviously keeping a very close eye on the situation and what's happening in Altadena and beyond. Yes, we're seeing some very strong gusts there. And I also just wanted to point out I just looked at Burbank Airport. It's currently sustained winds 58 miles an hour, gusting up to 83 in Burbank airport. So we're likely going to start seeing some trees coming down and some power outages right now around a good portion of the San Fernando Valley. Here's a look at the Eden fire from Mount Wilson camera. You can see how intense this flame front is right up along the ridgeline here. Some of the wind speeds around this fire are still very intense. You can see the Eden Canyon has been reporting gusts in the 30 to 35 mile per hour range. Same with Sierra madre, but look toward La Cañada Flintridge and you'll start seeing gusts in the 45 to 50 mile per hour range. We're getting what's called a mountain wave coming off the San Gabriel Mountains, where some of the upper atmospheric winds essentially are translating almost down to the surface, or being pulled down on the backside of this terrain. And we're seeing that a lot through the 210 corridor. And then on the other side of the Verdugo Mountains. That's why Burbank is seeing such intense wind gusts right now. Here's a look at the Palisades Fire, another spot where we're seeing some very gusty winds across the mountain, the Santa Monica mountains. You can see the wind gusts right now 75 miles an hour. But earlier we did have reports up to 85 miles an hour. Topanga beach, 43 mile per hour. Gusts still around Pacific Palisades, reporting about 26 mile per hour gusts. Here's a look at the overall gusts map. You'll notice on here this little red bit right over part of the San Fernando Valley. Burbank sits right under that. That's where that red coloring is coming from. The Verdugo Mountains are right here, but I would not be surprised if we start hearing a lot of very strong gusts reports coming out of the Sunland-tujunga area as well. We're still seeing some very strong gusts out of the Cajon Pass. Some of that red coloring just below Ontario. So we're likely seeing some gusts above 60 miles an hour through areas like Fontana or even Jurupa Valley. And some of that extends out to the Orange County coastline as well. That's just the main thing I just kind of wanted to touch on, and then I can send it back over to you guys, but we are starting to see some very, very strong gusts out there right now. This is the leading edge of that, that period that we're looking at tonight about 10:00 to maybe about 5:00 in the morning. We're going to be watching for these strong gusts. We've already got some of them happening around Burbank again, seeing wind gusts into the 80 mile per hour range. So we're going to keep an eye on that. And I would not be surprised if we start hearing more about power outages. Wow. 59 Ontario, 53 Van Nuys. I can't even imagine. Yeah, that's very, very strong gusts. And a reminder that the numbers I was just telling you for Burbank, these are the gusts for Van Nuys at 53. That's around the sustained winds at Burbank Airport right now. And that's a measure of the winds over a certain period of time. So for that entire period of time, it was pretty windy. And then you had a gust on top of it that was even stronger than that. Well, think of the planes going into Burbank airport right now. Yeah, exactly. It's a bumpy ride. On a normal day. Very. All right. Thank you. David, we're going to check in with Darsha Philips once again. She has been showing us what's going on there. A lot of first responders there on the street where you are. Darsha. What's happening now? So we are right near Palisades Village. Just take a look. We are right where all the stores are and the restaurants are. And just over here, a gas station caught fire and first responders were working really hard to put that out. You can see some flames also at the very top. We came on the other side of it because the smoke was just so bad. So further up this road is where I showed you earlier that massive apartment complex that was on fire, that first responders were trying to put those flames out. Well, literally just ten minutes ago, we saw two people being pulled out of that apartment complex, an elderly couple. They appeared to be okay. They were walking. The man was walking with a cane, and it appeared that they were inside that apartment complex as it was on fire and as first responders and firefighters were just dousing it with water trying to get those flames. Now you're also looking at another building that appears to be an apartment complex that is completely engulfed in flames. You saw how close we are to Palisades Village very close to the downtown, vibrant area of this, of this town, and we have flames and smoke. And again, we talked about the evacuations when we drove by, and we saw those two people being escorted out of the building by firefighters. I couldn't believe it. This was an elderly couple. I'm not sure if they weren't mobile enough or didn't have the help to get out of that apartment complex, but they had been inside that apartment complex as it was on fire, as water was pouring through, the woman that came out was completely drenched with water because she was inside that apartment complex. And I just really couldn't believe it, that they had just been evacuated. After all of that time, and all of that smoke and all of that flame that was surrounding that apartment complex. And again, we're here on Sunset Boulevard near Temescal Canyon, and you're still seeing very active flames. So much wind, so much smoke, lots of first responders, big fire engines with their long ladders, really trying to stop the fire here. They do not want it to get to the village again. We did see this US bank and a gas station that was on fire here, just so close to the village. And it appears that they were able to stop the flames at the U.S. Bank. And over there right now, we do see another building that is completely engulfed in flames. So again, we've been talking about this. The winds have not peaked yet. We are going to see these winds get stronger and stronger. And really it is just quite unbelievable the way that this fire is moving through this area, moving through the palisades, burning through buildings, apartment buildings and homes. We were just on Swathmore and we saw a couple of homes that had caught fire. So again, a dynamic situation out here, lots of smoke, lots of ash that's burning and raining down. And then the wind really takes the embers and moves it and spreads this fire. But really, what's so surprising to me right now are the number of people who have remained amidst this. You know, I would not be in this if I lived here. This is not something that anyone should stay back in. I know that the few people that we did see here were elderly, so I'm not sure if it was a case of mobility or just wanting to wait and see, but we have seen so many people who did not evacuate. And again, that couple that just came out of that apartment complex as it was on fire, had stayed in there for hours and hours as the firefighters tried to take out those flames. I'm not even sure that those firefighters knew that they were in there until they they were brought out of that apartment complex. So again, a very dynamic situation. You can see you can hear the winds kind of blowing through here. And it's going to be a long night for these firefighters and all the residents who are hoping that they have a home to come back to. We'll send it back to you guys. Well, I just hope that everybody who wants to get out has a way to get out, and they're not staying behind because they can't get out. And that's absolutely was was my thought exactly. Especially when I saw the elderly couple. I'm not sure if it was a mobility issue. And then also Sunset Boulevard right here was shut down because you had these big fire engines that were trying to put out the flames of that very large apartment complex. They didn't want that that to spread, to continue to spread. So Sunset Boulevard near Temescal Canyon, in both directions, directions were shut down. So we had a line of cars of people who were trying to get out, who couldn't. They couldn't get out through Temescal Canyon toward PCH because there were downed power lines. Those power lines were de-energized, but they couldn't drive through them because otherwise they would have gotten tangled through it. But again, right now, what we're seeing is just this fire over here continuing to explode in this wind. It is just really out of control. And what you can't see through the smoke is just next to it. Maybe you can. Right? There is another building that is completely on fire. So again, this is just such a tough situation. I am hoping that everyone was able to get out safely again. Heed those evacuation warnings. We sound like a broken record, but I'm saying it again here because I am so surprised at how many people stayed behind. And right now are trying to get out of this. We'll send it back to you guys. It makes you wonder why they stay. All right. Darsha, we appreciate that. We want to send it back out to NBC 4's Robert Kovacik, who continues our live team coverage near Amalfi and Sunset Boulevard there in the Palisades. Robert. You know, Michael and Kathy, if there is a belly of the beast with this fire, you may be looking at it right here we are off of Casal Road and we are watching this. What looks to be almost like the center of a volcano. And here you see the winds swirling. Just minutes ago it was clear and it just continues to swirl. And unfortunately the flames are moving uphill right now. There are two homes right there. You can probably see their beautiful glass fronts. And if you live in this area, we are monitoring this closely for you. We see the fire that is sort of crawling up this hillside on that side right there where those two homes are. And then one immediately in front of us. David, you can see right there that this these are flames here. The wind is pushing it in so many different directions that, you know, it's one of those things that when we come here with our news van, we make sure that, you know, we keep it running and it is facing in a direction that we can't get out and get out quick. As we have learned from firefighters over the decades, because again, this is a fire that just seems to be figuring out just what it wants to do and going at different places, at different times. So unfortunately, what we are, our view here from what should be a lovely vantage point throughout the year here in the Pacific Palisades, is right now the center of catastrophe with homes that are in peril. And we have people right here, as David shows you this shot, I'm going to go walk over here and see what's happening here with some of our other people that have been evacuated. We spoke with a man who just said, I'm just trying to get my mother out right now. This is sort of the area that we showed you before. This was the Amalfi and Sunset area of the Palisades. Again, all the Palisades under evacuation orders. But this one swiftly became you got to get out and get out now. And so this is just walking down the street. Look at there. There's another flank of the fire. And so when I say this deep canyon here in the Palisades is right now where this fire has just come here and it is churning and it is burning, and it is sending embers, and it is going in any which way, it just keeps going in different directions. So I want to give a shout out to our friend Steve Concialdi with the Orange County Fire Authority. He does confirm with NBC 4 tonight that OC fire is sending support here, understanding that the area here in L.A. County may be under much more of an extreme duress than in Orange County. So we're getting some help from neighboring counties. We've seen beach communities also send firefighters up here as well. So, you know, they have the resources. The problem is, is that we are witnessing tonight. It's just how do you get those resources to where it needs to go? I'm I'm pausing because it sounded like it was almost like a clap of thunder out there. It is. And what that is, is the sound of the wind swirling. So here we go. Another day of a careful right here. You see, there's LAPD coming to try and clear this area out, making sure no one is here. We haven't seen a lot of people here. We're going to come right up here again and show you. Careful here from this ledge. So the fire right now continues to burn out of control. And there are again, a number of homes that are being threatened at this hour. We have also heard from a number of our viewers. I am fielding messages and texts from them. Some say, I know we've lost four homes on our cul de sac. I know that this friend lost a home. This friend lost a home. So people are now just hearing about their properties that are not only been destroyed, that have been damaged, but unfortunately, if you are watching this live shot right now and you live in this area, these are the homes right now. These really spectacular homes in one of the most coveted places to live in all of the nation. Right now that are directly in harm's way as this fire just sort of roars up one hill and then decides to roar up another. So this is the cauldron that we are looking at here in the Pacific Palisades. Just to explain to you why we are looking then at the LAPD and why we have seen them going up and down these streets telling people to get out. This is the reason right here, everyone, because this fire right now is raging in this specific area, and it's been raging in this area known as the Pacific Palisades since about 1030 this morning. Robert, when you say belly of the beast, you are not kidding. That is exactly what it looks like. You talked about the embers breaking, Kathy. Just heartbreaking. And the other thing that you said, normally this would be a beautiful view. Yes, indeed. On a beautiful day, which is how we started the day, even with the winds. But tell me, how strong are the winds where you are right now and the air quality? Can you describe it really just sort of you're looking at, you know, just sort of if you could just watch the smoke, then you can see, wow, it's changing direction. It's moving this way. It's moving this way. So it's swirling. We have the gusts that David Biggar and Melissa Magee and Belen de León and Stephanie Olmo and our meteorologist and our incredible weather team have warned us about. We're getting those gusts. We certainly are. Just take a look at the trees right there. You can see it's blowing. But again just watch the smoke and you don't know which way it is going to blow. And just to go back a short time ago, we spent the afternoon at the Palisades and the Highlands telling you that the firefighters lafd these guys, somebody I'd worked with for a long, long time, said it's all going to the beach, Robert. It's all going to the beach. It's all going to the beach. And then a half hour later we were walking you east on sunset, saying that this fire is now pushing east. And we know now that it is it's forcing evacuations in Brentwood. It's forcing evacuations. Mandeville Canyon, and then we were back down by PCH and there it was just, you know, moving not only down PCH in both directions, heading west, heading east and then jumping PCH and just taking out those tractors that that clear the sand. And as we showed you live on NBC for just about an hour ago, one of the stations that that Will Rogers State Beach has set up for lifeguards and for facilities for you all to use completely on fire, nothing you can do. And that is when I underline heartbreaking, heartbreaking. Because even though we are surrounded with the best fire teams in the entire world, there is little that they can do in a fire like this. And so what you have heard from elected officials and what you have heard from fire officials, and what we have heard from longtime residents, this is something many of us have never seen before and certainly don't want to see again. I don't know what is happening to some of the homes here because again, Kathy and Michael, you see right there in that smoke two minutes ago, we showed you those two homes. You can't see them anymore. That doesn't mean there's anything happening. It just means that the fire and the smoke is clouding our view right now. From this vantage point. Again, what what you could describe as looking into the center of a volcano. But this is, ladies and gentlemen, Pacific Palisades. You know, Robert, you did a great job in illustrating how the winds have shifted from every location you've been in. And again, this is just proof of it. Yet once again. All right, Robert Kovacik there live for us. We want to get you up to speed here, folks. It's 9:00 at this hour. Two fires. As we've been telling you about, are burning out of control in our area. The latest one, the Eaton Fire, is near Altadena. And then the one you just saw there from Robert's vantage point, the Palisades fire that we have been covering, we have the latest on both breaking news stories. We begin with the Eaton fire that burned at least 400 acres just within the last half hour. We've seen several patients being evacuated from a senior center. This is on Altadena and Washington in the city of Pasadena. Elderly people there, you see them in wheelchairs getting loaded onto a bus and into other vehicles to get them out of harm's way. Now, the Pasadena Unified School District says all schools will be closed tomorrow. The other fire we're following, the Palisades fire. We've been covering it since 11 this morning. It exploded to nearly 3000 acres. That's the latest numbers we have right now. There are new evacuation orders for parts of Santa Monica, north of San Vicente. And again, all Malibu schools will be closed tomorrow. All right. Once again, we want to check in now with meteorologist David Becker. Of course, tracking the peak of these winds, David. And we're just about an hour away. Yeah, essentially, we are starting to see a couple of the gusts pick up across the region, but we will have a couple of hours of these gusts coming our way. And we're looking at some potentially damaging wind gusts with this, even though we've already had a lot of trees coming down, we're now potentially looking at wind gusts getting up into that 60 70 mile per hour range across a good chunk of some of our areas and some of our valley spots. I just want to show you what it looks like from our Mount Wilson camera right now. Looking back toward the Eden Fire. Initially when this fire started, it was essentially this pocket of our shot right here that was glowing. But you can see how this has been spreading out as it's been continuing to burn across the area. Very concerning. Obviously, with the amount of embers this has been putting up. And we've also been watching a lot of wind gusts across the area. And also I was just looking at some of the flight tracking apps out there, a lot of aircraft going into like Burbank, for example, or diverting and going to other airports right now because they can't land in the wind like this. I'm also not seeing a lot of firefighting aircraft up right now. This is the big challenge with all these winds is it's almost impossible to fight from the air when we've got wind gusts that are getting up into the 60 or 70 mile per hour range. And as you look at some of the observation sites near where the fire is burning, like Eden Canyon Park, for example, this, by the way, this observation sites down where the flatlands are right about where the entrance to the trailhead is. If you are going to go walk up to up Eden Canyon, but it's been reporting wind gusts in about the 35 to 45 mile per hour range. And that's been pretty consistent over the last hour. Sierra madre has been looking at wind gusts in about the 30 to 35 mile per hour range. This Altadena observation site actually got a little bit lighter, but around La Cañada Flintridge we're also looking at some of those pretty strong gusts in that 40 to 50 mile per hour range. So obviously with gusts like this, there's the potential for what we call long range spotting where you can start spot fires miles away from the actual fire itself. Part of the reason why we're telling everybody in an evacuation area to just leave, don't sit there trying to defend your property, leave because spot fires will be starting beyond where you are most likely. Here's a looks like for the Pacific Palisades fire, so you can see that we've got some areas around the Pacific Palisades and about the 25 to 35 mile per hour range gusts wise. But around Topanga Beach it's been pretty gusty. But look at the Santa Monica mountains still gusting above 60 miles an hour right now. And a reminder, as Michael was mentioning, we still have plenty of hours of this ahead of us. We are just coming into some of the peak winds right now, and we'll likely still have that into the early morning hours for tomorrow. Here's what we're talking about right now. Van Nuys, 59 miles an hour. We've got wind gusts. Wind gusts around 32 for LAX, 59 around Ontario, 44 for Riverside. If you look closely at the map, you see this red here and you see this white, the whites, the upper end of our wind scale for our wind gusts. That's where we have wind gusts above 70 miles an hour, which we have had because Burbank Airport was reporting gusts into the 80 mile per hour range. So that is probably why we're starting to get a lot of reports of power outages across the region. I talked a little bit about what we call long range spotting. I want to show you an example of fire spotting. Now this comes from a previous fire. This is not one of the fires today. This is the bridge fire. This is the one that burned near the mountain high area up near Wrightwood in the San Gabriel Mountains. So for this, the fire is in the trees. This entire meadow is not ignited yet. I'm going to play through this and we're going to play it in real time. This is not sped up or anything. So we're going to get a couple of seconds in and we'll pause around the six second mark, because you'll see that across the screen. We've got all these little bits and pieces of ash and embers. It only takes one to start a spot fire, and you can see how many are on the screen at this point. Now I'm going to play through it again in regular time here. And I want you to pay attention to this meadow area down below, because as each of these individual embers lands in this dry grass, you start starting, you start a whole bunch of spot fires. So now you can see we've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, up to almost ten. Spot fires out of the main fire which is still in the trees. It's just throwing embers out ahead of it. This is also helping to preheat all of that fuel in that meadow. And it only took another 30s or so for the fire to get from here in the trees, down to where this camera was. And then that was it for this camera when this fire was happening. So that's how quickly a spot fire can help spread the fire itself. We've had all the elements of the wildfire triangle today. We have the fuel. It is incredibly dry and there's almost no moisture in the field. We've had almost no rain this season. The weather, well, it's extremely windy right now. It is very dry out there and the topography, both fires are burning through very steep terrain right now with some canyons which create gusting winds. This is going to be a very big challenge for firefighters. And again, we do not necessarily have the opportunity to attack from the air tonight. So it's all going to be ground fighting. All right. Thank you so much David. We're going to check in right now with NBC 4's. Macy Jenkins. Last time people were evacuating from a wellness center, we saw people who needed extra care, wheelchairs, and they were on stretchers in some cases. And now we see why Macy we see the flames that are there behind you. Can you tell us more just. Yeah, Kathy, we're just a few blocks north of where that wellness center is. You can see the tree just across the street. I'd say three minutes ago that tree was not on fire, and now it is blowing in the wind. And you see the embers coming towards us. All of this area, many of these homes, I see spot fires in front of them. Incredibly, there were still Christmas lights on in one of these, these yards, but there were embers coming down this driveway. We now see certain work trucks leaving the area. A few minutes ago, there was a gentleman on the corner who was wearing a mask and goggles, and he was still just watching all of this with just a t shirt on. I couldn't get to him to talk to him, to ask him why he is still here. This wind and this smoke is now blowing us. I would say self, the embers are now becoming more and more frequent. And take a look at this tree that my photographer just pointed out to me. It has just caught fire. That tree was not on fire 30s ago. The firefighters coming this way and I'm using our truck to brace to brace. Myself. We're seeing the firefighters coming down this way or excuse me, going towards more north. But if you look at that tree, it is there are now embers that are likely going to catch some of these homes on fire in this neighborhood. I'm hoping that the people who are here have already evacuated. I only saw one man. I haven't seen anyone else outside or peeking their heads outside. But as you can see how thick the smoke is and how fast, how strong the wind is, this fire is moving so quickly. I actually think this is time for us to get back in the truck, because those flames are just a few feet away from where we are right now. So I'll send it back to you guys. All right. Macy, thank you so much. Joining us on the phone right now, Lucy Jones. And thank you so much for joining us here. As we talk about this fire disaster, we usually talk to you about earthquakes, but we're thinking maybe you could talk to us a little bit about the psychological side of entire neighborhoods being destroyed. I yes, it's very much, in fact, like an earthquake. Fundamental psychological response to how we feel when we're in danger and when the disaster grows beyond an individual. I mean, when your house burns, it's a disaster. When the whole community goes, it's just in a whole it's a disaster for everyone. And that changes the scale of it and changes our emotional response to it. And the biggest thing is the scale of it means it's hard to feel in control. And when we feel out of control, we're more scared. We're more frightened of that when we don't understand it, when it's uncertain, all of those things increase our fear and this sort of thing is going to, you know, when is it going to come? I can smell it. What's going to happen next? And one of the best ways to deal with this is really to reach out to someone you think might need help. I mean, do you know what your neighbors are doing? Do they need help? Do you? Should you walk over and knock on their door, send them a text and just check to make sure they're okay? If you're under an evacuation watch, are you sure that your neighbors have a way of getting out and some people are bedridden? Right? Right, right. Yeah. Doctor Jones, we actually had a chief Sam DiGiovanna on, and that was one of his talking points to check on your neighbors. But let's talk about the psychological guilt, perhaps of those whose homes survive and their neighbors just down the street. Don't there there are some feelings there as well. Oh, it's always very difficult. You feel guilty? Why was I spared? At the same time, you're so grateful that you're spared. But, you know, one of the aftermath things, the people who were able to move back, the neighborhoods not going to be the same. I was evacuated for the station fire and none of our house, the neighborhood burned. We all were able to come back safely, but it smelled like an ashtray. For the next six months. And Doctor Jones, can we go back to 2011 when Pasadena had that just bizarre wind event? I had just moved out. I went back every tree at the house I had lived in was down, and it looked like a war zone. I couldn't even believe it. I was. We had just moved back to Pasadena from La Canada a few months before that storm hit, and yeah, it was pretty extraordinary to go through that night with the noise and very much what's happening tonight reminds me of that. And we just had our neighbor's house come down on our garage. You know, trees are going to be coming down all night here. And it's a it's very disorienting, you know, and that uncertainty and that's again, so helping your neighbors means fewer people are going to die. But it's also good for you. I have I activated a disaster response group that I had helped form a couple of years ago and just. Is everybody okay? Who who needs what? Somebody was evacuated. Somebody else offered them help, and we all felt better because we'd done something. We put some control on it. You know, we're willing to take risks if there's a meaning to it. And if you can provide meaning by helping others, it makes it easier to manage the risk. You know, Doctor Jones, we're looking at video as we speak with you about some of the most vulnerable. These are patients who are being evacuated from a wellness center. Perhaps recovery for them psychologically and mentally with an event like this may not be as easy for them. Well, right. Because when you're dependent on others, when you're even more out of control, that increases the fear. It's the same thing for children. You know, they have to depend on their adults for everything. And when the adults get scared or need to deal with the disaster and push the kids to the side, that increases their fear. So one of the other things we found after the Northridge earthquake was the more you can involve your children in the response and the, you know, picking things back up and talking to them if you are having to evacuate, all of that is going to make it easier for them, because just remember, they're already in a life where they're always out of control and they're, you know, yeah, but, you know, some might say, Doctor Jones, I have an 11 and 15 year old. I want to arm them with the information that I believe they need to be armed with. I don't want to oversaturate them with information that I as an adult, can handle, but perhaps they can't handle. Right? Oh, yeah. You don't want to give them more than they can cope with, but you also don't want to shut them out, right? Right. You don't want to say, don't worry about it. I got it covered because they know there's a problem and they just don't have the information then. So giving them the amount that they can handle that makes them understand that you are in control and you are taking care of them, because that's going to be their big fear. When the parent runs off to go handle something and they get left. Well, Doctor Jones, you always make us feel better when you give us earthquake information. And now I know, even sharing your wisdom with us tonight. I'm just wondering, you said it's very windy where you are. How do you feel about the next few hours? We know the winds are going to increase and the fire danger is close to you in Altadena, right? Yeah, it's the evacuation watch area is less than a mile away from me. We're making sure that if we had to, if we woke up in the middle of the night, we could get out of the house in a couple of minutes. That the things we want to take are, are near at hand. And that's partly our experience of having been evacuated before again, feel a little bit more in control, makes it easier to manage it. All. Right. Before we let you go, Doctor Jones, of course. Just one more question. Fear the unknown. We don't know what's going to happen over the course of the next, you know, 1 to 2, six, 16 hours from now. So what advice would you give us in terms of coping again, not knowing what may or may not happen? Be. Well, it's like, you know, the earthquake, you can't control the earthquake, but you can control your environment. So yeah, put things down. Be ready to evacuate if you need to. I mean, in this, you know, you can't stop the fire if it really gets going through. But being ready so that, you know, that puts you more in control. And then the next thing I think is really that thing of reaching out to others, your neighbors or family that you think might need some help that's going to make you both calmer to handle it. If you actually did have to get evacuated. Beneficial for both. All right. Doctor Lucy Jones, as always, we appreciate you. Thank you, thank you. Okay. All right. Well hopefully we will see a better night once people who need to be evacuated get out. And we do wrap our heads around what needs to be done. It's an excellent idea that she pointed out, checking on neighbors, having neighbors check on you, making sure you've got your to go. If people can evacuate, give them a ride. Just seeing what people need and coming through. Yeah, and I like how she said it's not only beneficial for those you are who are helping, you are helping, but it helps you as well. Yeah. All right. Well, we're getting some first hand accounts from people who have been impacted by the Palisades Fire. Alex Rozier talked to a man who stayed behind just to protect homes. There we are in a neighborhood that's been hit hard by fire here. Derek Bok lives a few blocks away. You've stuck around today, Derek. You've been around this neighborhood for 20 years. First, I want to say via Santa Ynez and Jackson were right near Marquez Elementary. Tell me about your day, your experience so far? It's been a little harrowing. It started off this morning where I. I saw a small plume of smoke, and I was concerned all morning, obviously, because the wind was so strong and saw the small plume of smoke. And about 30 minutes later I thought, maybe we'll be okay, because it was blowing a little bit to the side of us, but it's just spread everywhere. So it's been a day of watching it and kind of keeping tabs and helping out neighbors. And, you know, a few crazy things going on. Absolutely. And I want to give a live look at that straight ahead. We're looking directly to the north here at Enchanted Way, where there are several homes that have caught fire. You used to live a few homes down from where we're standing. But I want to go to your point on the neighbor. You actually said that a few of you worked to help save a neighbor's house, is that right? There was a neighbor's house that we were walking by with a with a retired firefighter and looked over and saw a fire on the side of the house. So we ran up there and my son had a fire extinguisher and put it partially out. But it was it was too big for that. So we got we were able to get a hose and put water on it for about 5 or 10 minutes and got it out, and then found that the guest house door was also open with the curtains blowing in the wind. And, you know, embers were flying all over. So we were able to shut that and get that fire out. So maybe it saved the house, I don't know, 20 years in the neighborhood. Have you ever seen flames this close to so many homes? I've never seen flames like this. No, this this is the first time we've had a lot of fires. I've seen a lot of smoke. And a few times I've seen, you know, the red glare. But I've never seen homes that I actually, I know these houses because I've lived here for 20 years. I know which house that is that's burning. I know which houses they're right next to mine that are burning. So it's nothing like this ever. You know, these houses and you know many of these people. I want to end with this just on a on a human note tonight. Just what is your feeling watching this neighborhood that you care about, the people that you you care about here? What has this been like? Really hard. I think it it really hit me when I heard that all the trees around high were burning because I have. My youngest son is still going to poly high. So, you know, hope hopefully that the high school survives. I don't know, I haven't ■been down there yet, so it's you know, I teared up a few times. Well, we're going to be watching this with you tonight. Give you a live look one more time. Derek, thank you so much for your time. I wish the best for you and your family. This neighborhood looking at Enchanted Way in the distance. There. We were there earlier. We saw several homes that had caught fire on that roadway, specifically near the intersection of Enchanted Way and El Oro. And we've been watching this, this fire continue to grow. And not just the fire continuing to grow. We've we've watched the wind intensify. And that is what we're looking at right now. And we expect that that wind will continue to be strong into the night. So we're just hoping for the best for this neighborhood. Colleen all the people and the families, the homes that are here, we'll send it back to you. All right. Alex Rozier reporting there for us. We want to bring in meteorologist David Biggar. And David, I just got an email alert from my daughter's school, which happens to be on the West side, not in the evacuation or at risk zones whatsoever, but they're going to have school tomorrow, but everything is going to be modified. Any outdoor activity is going to be modified. I can only assume other schools in and around these fire zones are going to do the very same thing. Would not be surprised to hear that. And there's multiple reasons for that. First of all is the obvious one. You can see how much smoke, for example, the Eaton fire is putting up. This is just blowing down into lower elevations. The winds are so strong right now. This the smoke is not able to rise very high off the fire before being blown down to lower elevations. You've seen from all of the reporters tonight walking around showing you the scenes down below, the fires. They've been in smoke. They've been coughing, there's been ash. There's been embers flying around the air quality itself from the fires is one thing. One other thing. Some people may have noticed this earlier today, especially around the San Fernando Valley. When we got our initial burst of wind earlier this morning, a lot of dust got picked up. We haven't had very much rainfall at all this season, so we've got a lot of dust, we've got a lot of particulates, everything just sitting on the ground. And essentially you're taking almost like a big leaf blower and just blowing the ground. So it's knocking up all of that dust. It was definitely a reduced a little bit of a reduction of visibility in some parts of the area today. Not like fog, but just a little bit of a reduction, which told me that there was enough particulates in the atmosphere that you definitely want to have a mask on. If you're outside. Then once the winds calmed down for that little afternoon lull that we were talking about, not really a lull, but, you know, not as strong as it was earlier this morning. The visibility got better because it wasn't as much dust being kicked up. So I think tomorrow will also have some dust getting kicked up as the winds are still gusting. I wanted to show you a look from satellite. This is what we call fire temperature, where the pixel color correlates to how intense the fire is burning, and also kind of shows you the general area, the Palisades fire still burning intensely, still expanding in size. The thing that's starting to get a little concerning is as we look toward the Eden fire, it originally started as a small pixel. Now we're starting to see some brighter yellow colors on there, an indication of more intense fire activity through some parts of the fire. And that's likely because the winds are picking up. Look at Altadena wind gusts above 40 miles an hour. Now. Eden Canyon Park reporting wind gusts above 60 miles an hour. And we're starting to see some of those winds in the 35 to 45 mile per hour range around La Cañada Flintridge. So again, this is the concern that we have for tonight is when these gusts are picking up, it's really going to ramp up the fire activity and it's going to take any embers from this fire, and it's going to blow it toward the lower elevations. Which is why if you get any sort of evacuation warning, you have to listen to it. You have to leave. Don't stick around trying to fight this stuff. There's so many embers that the fire activity would be moving very quickly back to you. All right. We're going to watch out for that air quality too. Not just the kids that have to be in school, but everyone and people who are compromised, especially. Exactly. All right. We're going to check in with NBC 4's. Darsha Philips. She is near Palisades Village now. Darsha. Hey there guys. Yeah, the wind is just intensifying. We were in our truck trying to take a break from the smoke, and our truck was rocking because this wind was so strong. Now we've kind of moved through Palisades Village and come over this way. And we see we were actually very surprised to see even more fire on this side. This is one of the spot fires. And again, this is when these embers get blown by this wind and then catch one of these very dry brush that we have here and ignite. And this again is the problem. So many firefighters are facing right now. Now I do want to just take you over this way, because I want to show you on this side of sunset, that orange glow. Those are two more homes that are burning here, right near Palisades Village. So again, these conditions, you can hear the wind. You can see how we're struggling to kind of keep our footing here because the wind is blowing so strong. We again, have been saying that it hasn't peaked yet, and we are still feeling these extremely strong gusts now just down the street here. We did have an apartment complex that was on fire. I want to show you some video of two people, an elderly couple who were rescued from that burning apartment complex, but they were inside that apartment complex for at least two hours as firefighters tried to put out the flames. When the woman came out, she was actually drenched because of all the water that was being poured onto that apartment complex. It is not clear if the firefighters even knew that they were inside. Again, evacuation orders had gone out. We were there when the building right next to that apartment complex had been evacuated. It was a senior assisted care living center that had been evacuated. It was assumed that everyone had gotten out of that apartment complex. But again, we saw those people and it was it was really terrifying to see that someone had been inside that apartment complex while it was on fire. Now, if you can come back to our picture here live, you can see that orange glow of the fire. We are moving away from Temescal Canyon. We thought that we were actually moving out of the fire, but you can see that things are still on fire. That is a home that is actively burning right now. And we're going to show you over here. Take a look at this wind. This is what this wind is doing. When I talk about a blow torch. This wind is just taking these embers and pushing them, sometimes for miles and starting spot fires miles away. Because these these winds are so strong, it really is unbelievable conditions. I've said it before. I've covered fires here in Northern California and Southern California. These conditions are extreme. These conditions are nothing like I've ever seen. It is why these firefighters are having a really hard time getting a handle on these flames. And you just saw it switch, right? You just saw that that wind shift, it was blowing one way and then it shifted toward us. So again, these situations are so, so difficult and so dangerous. And this is what firefighters are having to deal with out here in the Palisades. All right. We'll send it back to you guys. Another example of the challenges out there. All right, Darsha, thank you for that. We want to now turn our attention to NBC 4's Alex Rozier, who continues our live team coverage. Alex, give us a location. And obviously we see active flames here in your shot. Yeah. Michael. So what we're going to do is we're going to turn around and we're going to head southbound on Pacific Coast Highway, because you can see the flames. We were efforting trying to get closer to Duke's, where we're hearing of some ongoing incidents that I believe you have some more facts on. But PCH is just too much of a firestorm right now. I have to tell you that the drive here it was. It's almost indescribable to tell you what we've witnessed, and it's so widespread, this this fire. I mean, I was in the Palisades since 10 a.m. This morning. And to see this ongoing right now and to come all this way to Malibu, it's really shocking. Once this fire truck goes past us here, we're going to go we're going to continue on down Pacific Coast Highway and you'll see some of what I'm talking about right up against the Pacific Ocean here. There's so many homes that have caught fire. Let me see if I can. Our signal, as you may expect, is a bit spotty. Anybody who has been out here knows that cell phone strength is weak. Out on Pacific Coast Highway, but you can see these flames that have taken over so many of these homes. And it goes for miles. I will tell you that we saw the real in in Malibu. So many people know that spot. And it was up in flames too when we passed it earlier. But now we'll continue on down this road here. And we just keep on driving and there's more and more destruction everywhere you look. You know, I've spent some time covering stories out here. So many of these families. We got to be careful about power line here. But. So many of these families have lived here for decades and. And as far as you drive, there are homes and businesses that have burned. I had. They took Temescal Canyon down. And as you're driving down the canyon, there was fire. Sides went into Santa Monica for a moment. We came out here on Pacific Coast Highway, and we've been seeing. Okay, we were obviously having some cell phone connectivity issues there with Alex as he makes that drive down PCH, but the pictures, those live pictures are very telling as to again, just another portion of this area again under fire. We know that the evacuation orders have extended into Santa Monica at this point. Alex, are you back with us right now? I am back with you right now. Yes. If you can hear me, I can hear you. Give us an idea of exactly where you are. We know you're headed towards the Malibu area from the Palisades on PCH. Yes, we've actually now turned around Colleen and we are headed back southbound on PCH towards Santa Monica. You can see here the flames continue. Yes. We to give you more of an exact location of where we are. We are on PCH and we are quickly approaching Tuna Canyon Road. And you can see the homes that are right side Allman. It's tough to make out what it is exactly that we're looking. Obviously a number of homes, but businesses to it's very heartbreaking. We've been talking about this fire in the Palisades for most of the day. This one almost 3000 acres at this point. But again, late this evening, right around 630, 7:00, another fire broke out. This is in the Altadena Kinneloa, Eaton Canyon area. That one has exploded to over 400 acres at this point. We have we have had Macy Jenkins out in that particular area for us all evening long. We saw her as a wellness center, was being evacuated with a number of patients and I believe Macy you estimated anywhere from 40 to 45 patients. Now you are just are you are you north of that facility here? Now? We are. We're about a block and a half north of that facility. The fire moving from north to south. Now, Michael, if you'll take a look across the street, there is a tree, a large tree that has caught fire. To the north of that is a house where firefighters said, okay, we've got to go. We cannot save that. We've got to go a little bit south. They made their way down just next to next door, and that is where you see this tree fully engulfed in flames, the embers now flying in the wind. You can see over by the street sign there. There is a no outlet sign that's barely visible and that has been banging up against that. Looks like a small retaining wall. The bush across the street completely on fire. Firefighters were parked there just moments ago. They've now gone across the street to park and they've got their hose that they're trying to get this fire out with. Now, moments ago, there was a gentleman that just asked my photographer and myself, how do I get out of here? And that is because it is impossible to see which way is north. Which way is south, because you can't see the street signs in front of you. You're going to have to go very slowly. But that is the very latest here on Altadena. Many homes on fire, two that we can see with our own eyes. Looking at the firefighters trying to put that out, I'll send it back to you. All right. Macy we continue to get more information on this particular fire. But again, we're covering two fires right now. Robert Kovacik is an area for Robert Fisher. Location, and we can see what's happening here. Call it Colleen. I can't hear you because we're right now in the middle of a firestorm. This is Sunset Boulevard. David is showing you one house on on fire. It's completely gone. You can see just how strong the wind is and how it is pushing these flames now, pushing them right up into other homes that are right here on sunset. You can see a single firefighter there just desperately trying to put out the fire with the palm tree. But look to no use. It is that bad. It is that intense. What we have been warned will happen in these over in these evening hours and into the overnight hours is happening. But the flames you see right there, that house right there is gone. And you see that how how the wind is pushing those flames. So we have other homes here along sunset that are in complete danger, that there is nothing these firefighters can do. You see them? You see the trucks have arrived here. But again, this is a firefight where the wind is winning the battle. There is there is embers that are flying everywhere up the street. So we are pushing now. On sunset. Towards David. Remember what that street was called one more time. Fisk. Fisk. So this is Sunset and Fisk. Other side of the street. It looks like a home completely gone there. But this is like a hurricane in the middle of a brushfire. You've got people right there. Is that a homeowner that's trying to leave? Is this your house? Yeah. Which is your house? Yeah, this is our house. Backyard is on fire. I'm out of here. Oh, my gosh. So what happened? Is there anything we could do to help you, sir, you can take these paintings. I guess I can't ride with these. Listen, I'll take them for you. I work at NBC. Thank you. I'll make sure you get them. What's your name? My name is Francois Aru. (310) 460-8805. Okay. You don't want to give that number out, but we've got these. We've got these from you. Come and find them from me at NBC. But again. So here, you see, I'm taking my bike out to you guys. Okay. Someone leaving? He just told me this gentleman that his home is on fire. His backyard is on fire. David's going to go right up here and show us right here at this intersection. Another home completely gone. So this is by far the worst that it has been all day. So Mark, this our Colleen Kathy. I will tell you, it is not it is not. We have not experienced winds like this. We have not experienced this intensity and we have not experienced a situation where we just have one house after another that is completely on fire. Look at that firefighter there by himself, trying to do what he can to try and put out this fire. But listen, it's like putting a water pick on something like this. There's nothing you can do. The winds are are just are just that bad. So as we watch the embers fly here along these homes, as we stand on sunset, we were pushing towards the beach, trying to get to the beach, but it was a very, very rough ride as we tried to make our way there. And right now we are at sunset near Fisk as one home, and several others right now are going up in flame. All right. Robert Kovacik there live for us on Sunset and Fisk. We would suggest you pack your crew up and get out of what we consider a danger zone at this point. Colleen. He says this is the worst the wind has been all day. That seemed to be obvious from the pictures we've seen all day. We're going to get the official announcement about that from David Biggar. David, what are the gusts out there right now? We're seeing some very intense gusts up in the mountains. We're still seeing gusts up above 70 miles an hour, almost 80 miles an hour. So depending on where Robert is, we're potentially seeing anywhere between 40 to 60 mile per hour wind gusts. One of the things you're seeing there is just how far the embers are traveling. But it's also a good reminder of just kind of a basic fire principle. If you think about campfires, if you think about maybe fires in a fireplace, if you blow on it, or you add some fresh air to it, it kind of reignites itself. We have a constant supply of that tonight because of all the gusty winds. So essentially the firefighter is doing his best to try to put out one of the trees there, one of those palm trees, which has a tendency to just let off tons of embers. But he's doing his best. But as he's hitting it, essentially it's getting fresh oxygen, getting supplied to it, and the fire just keeps burning. Here's the fire near Eden Canyon again. This is from our Mount Wilson camera, still burning very intensely right now. All the smoke blowing down into lower elevations and unfortunately taking embers with it. So that's another concern that we have. Look at some of these wind gusts though, that we're starting to get now coming off of the San Gabriel Mountains, Eden Canyon Park again, the flat area not up in the actual canyon itself, reporting wind gusts of 64 miles an hour currently with sustained winds of 34 miles an hour. That easily has the ability to carry embers for miles. So that is part of the reason why firefighters are doing their best to try to, like, contain some of the fire. But obviously they're going to have to make hard decisions on which properties are protecting and which spots they can try to set up. We have La Cañada Flintridge and Altadena both reporting wind gusts in about the 30 to 40 mile per hour range. So we're likely going to see those winds pick up as well. Back over near the Palisades Fire. This is what we're talking about with Robert. Look at Topanga Beach. Wind gusts up around 50 miles an hour. At this point. Pacific Palisades this observation site has held pretty constant at about 25 mile per hour wind gusts. But up in the mountains again, the ridge top observation site is reporting sustained winds of 64 miles an hour, gusting as high as 80 miles an hour. That is why we're seeing such wild wildfire behavior across parts of the Palisades. Just because it's just carrying embers everywhere, and it's essentially all modes of fire spread. At this point. We've got crowning happening where it's going from treetop to treetop faster than it's burning on the ground. We've got spot fires that are happening, and the fire is likely also creating some swirling winds, which is making it very difficult for firefighters to figure out which direction this is going to start burning, because we've had the fire going in this direction, even though we've had north winds for much of the day. So this is something that we're going to be watching as we get into the next couple of hours. But again, we are really going right now into the period of the strongest wind gusts across the region. You can see parts of the San Fernando Valley looking at wind gusts above 59 miles an hour. So almost 60 miles an hour. Same with some parts of the Inland Empire. Santa Clarita right now reporting wind gusts nearly 55 miles an hour. So across the entire region, the wind gusts are picking up. We're likely going to start seeing a lot of power outages as trees come down. I highly recommend if you haven't been doing so. Maybe you've been trying to keep track of all the updates today on your phone. Plug your phone in, plug in anything you can to get it charged up. If the power goes out, the phone is what you're going to need to give you a warning if anything happens across the region, I'll send it back over to you guys. As you mentioned that David Michael reached down and plugged his phone in. It's a very, very good reminder for all of us. One of the reasons why I did, I just got a text from my wife, the power is out at our place. Okay. Yeah. So my wife texted me, North Hollywood is without power too. So yeah. So we're feeling it. All right, David, thank you. On the phone with us right now, Margaret Stewart with L.A. City Fire. And I understand we're hearing about some of the people and firefighters who have been injured in Malibu. Margaret. Hello. Yes, we did have about 8:30 p.m. We had a 25 year old female LAFD firefighter who sustained a serious head injury. She received immediate treatment on scene and was transported to a trauma center for further evaluation. And there are some civilian injuries. At about 9 p.m, there were multiple burn victims that were walking towards a nearby restaurant, and the incident operations redirected medical resources to them to provide evacuation treatment and transported as needed. In terms of the characteristics of this fire here right now, we had you on the show earlier here this afternoon. We had a Robert Kovacik with us not too long ago, he said. The winds that he is actually in the midst of now are the worst they've been all day long. Would you agree with that? Yes, absolutely. And we know the winds are forecasted to worsen overnight. So unfortunately it's only going to get more challenging, which is why it's so important for all of your viewers to abide by our evacuation orders. The map has been updated about an hour and a half ago to further north, up to Mullholland and right or east towards Kelter. And so that map at LAFD org, they can see that and anyone effectively all of Pacific Palisades. And we know also now Santa Monica, you know, to the east southeast of our fire is also evacuating. So it's really important that people abide by that. Margaret. We heard David Biggar say just a moment ago, we're seeing all sorts of fire patterns within these fires. Typically, we see fire burn uphill, not very often downhill, but we're definitely seeing some of that as well today. Is that because of the winds? Absolutely. The winds, you know, that would normally be coming off the ocean are coming from land that, you know, our Santa Ana winds. So it's pushing it down the hillsides and then the fire, as large as it is now, it starts to kind of create its own weather. And the winds will swirl and the ember cast can travel a mile downwind and start a spot fire. So it's very dynamic and challenging to predict fire, which is why we have such an expansive evacuation zone. We want to get everybody out of the area safely. I mentioned this earlier that this particular fire in the Palisades specifically doesn't seem to have a starting and finish line. It is just all over the place. Can you talk about the challenge of getting a handle on a fire like this, when you know you're working on one part of it, and all of a sudden there are three more spot fires that pop up, you know, a half a block two miles away. Right? That's that's what's so challenging about this type of fire. And especially in this type of topography where we've got mountainous, you know, mountains with heavy brush. And unfortunately, because of the extreme winds, we're experiencing, our air support is not able to fly. So that makes it even more challenging. And so our, you know, our firefighters are positioned throughout trying to defend as many homes as possible and continue to fight the fire. And we will be out there all night doing so. But it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be over quickly. You know, this is it's a war that we're raging. Margaret, is there any special strategy as we move into these high intensity wind hours? The next few hours here, anything differently that you'll see firefighters do throughout the evening? Not differently per se. When we have such extreme winds, it affects the, you know, the water stream from your hoses that you can't reach as far because the wind will just brush it, just push it aside. So we have to get in there. We have to get close. But the tactics and the strategies effectively remain the same. It just becomes, you know, a bit more dangerous because we lose visibility and the winds will be increasing. And this is just the scenario that we face. Are you expecting additional resources to be moved into the area for the for the fire? Well, the Cal Fire Incident Management Team will be taking over the management of the incident in the morning, and they are the ones that can bring in resources from outside the region statewide. So I don't have the details on what their plans are, but those are under underway. Earlier today, we saw the super Scoopers out there doing the best they could. Obviously at night with the winds and all the other issues, the super scoopers, the fixed wing have to put down. Do you expect a stronger aerial assault tomorro? It's entirely dependent on the weather. You know, we it's something that they're constantly evaluating. And as soon as we're able to safely get the aircraft up, they'll be up. So there's not a it's not a timeline. We're not waiting for a certain time. We're just waiting for that window where they can get up and safely be and be effective. Because in these, you know, these extreme winds, they're just not effective. So essentially you're saying we're at the mercy of Mother Nature and the weather. Unfortunately, yeah. We're we're doing the best we can possibly do. And Mother Nature just isn't going to help us for a while. That's just the sad situation. Margaret Stewart with LAFD. We certainly appreciate your time and your expertise. As I understand it, one firefighter injured at this point, a 25 year old woman with a serious head injury and several other people around 9:00, apparently, apparently sustained severe burns just being out in the area. Right. All right. We want to now we have on the phone Trey Robertson, who is a fire photographer who can you're here to talk about, you know, the injuries that we just mentioned here in Malibu. What more do you know about this? So down at Duke's restaurant, which is on PCH at Carbon Canyon in Malibu, a number of walk ups showed up. Residents that presented with burn injuries from big Rock area and the Carbon Canyon area, presumably homeowners. There was extreme fire behavior in that area. Wind gusts 70 plus miles an hour. Very difficult even to stand up getting blown over down PCH from those wind gusts. They brought in a number of paramedic squads and ambulances and transported them to hospitals. Can you give us an idea of how many people hard to get. I don't have an accurate count, but it was multiple. It was 3 or 4 at least, and the injuries sustained. There was one that presented with a fractured leg, and then there were multiple burn victims. Trey, do you have any idea what they were doing out there? Did you have a chance to talk with them at all? Well, I didn't talk with them at all because paramedics are busy obviously treating them. They they came down from the homes that were on fire. They were presumably residents that were just self evacuating. And for whatever reason, walking out on foot. We are talking about multiple burn victims at this point. Again, we're trying to access more information on this. Your your advice to anyone. Again, as we look at these live pictures here, who perhaps didn't evacuate, not thinking about evacuating your words of wisdom to them. You know, this is as your spokesperson from LAFD just said, Mother nature is in control here. Or not. And if you feel in danger, you need to evacuate. This is the worst fire that I've been on and I've seen in 30 years. Aircraft are grounded because of extreme turbulence. So fire is doing what it wants to do pretty much unchecked at this point. Trey, if you had to make a comparison between this and the Franklin Fire in Malibu, what, a month ago, 4 or 5 weeks ago at this point, this that much more serious? Yeah, it's exponentially more serious. I mean, it's burning in two directions, east and west. And, you know, we don't have the benefit of night flying helicopters because of the turbulence like we did in the Franklin Fire. It's much more dangerous, much more extreme fire behavior. All right. Trey Robertson there, a fire photographer giving us more information, a little more insight on those injuries there sustained by those folks in Malibu. And again, he said this is the worst fire that he's been on or seen in his years. It looks like these were residents maybe coming down from big Rock and or Carbon Canyon. And you wonder, you have to wonder if there were people who stayed behind to try to do what they could to save their homes and then just got caught, right? Will again try to ascertain more information on that. But in the meantime, we want to bring in NBC 4's Amber Frias, who's live for us there in Altadena. And Amber, describe to us what you've seen since being on scen. Hey guys. Yeah, I'm at the intersection of New York and Altadena Drive. This is an area full of homes or homes in every direction. And some of these homes already on fire here, where you see on your screen. This home doesn't appear to have caught fire yet. But behind it, there are trees, there's shrubs, something big that appears to be building. We saw a lot of dark smoke coming. Also to the right of that home, we've seen palm trees catch fire. A lot of dark smoke coming from that direction, and then also on the left, it appears there's multiple homes, multiple trees on fire. It is really windy out here. It's been windy since we were making our way into the area. We the wind was actually rocking our van back and forth. We saw street signs almost falling off from their poles. Excuse me, the smoke is pretty thick out here and you can see cars driving by, but for the most part, from what we've seen, it seems pretty quiet out here. There is no electricity. We haven't really seen a lot of residents in the area. Micah Ma'a Colleen I think I'm going to toss it back to you. I'm having a hard time going to stay with your live shot, because I do have a quick question for you about the area there, and that is which direction this fire seems to be burning as you face the mountains. Amber just yes or no? Is it burning towards the mountains? Yes or no? I heard someone was blowing to the southwest. It appears to be burning to the southwest. South southwest. Okay, so it's south southwest. It's burning down Altadena and more towards the. I don't want to say the Rose Bowl, but more towards that direction. Lake. Okay, a little bit more in a southerly direction, South southwest, South southwest. Okay. Got it. Thank you. I will let Amber there catch your breath as she is continuing our coverage there on the 400 acre Eaton fire there in Altadena. David Biggar is back with us now to give us an update on on the conditions. Just wanted to give a quick update on the gusts. We're starting to see some incredible numbers right now across some parts of the area. Look at Eden Canyon Park. One of the observation sites is actually a SoCal Edison site right now, reporting wind gusts at 70 miles an hour. So that's easily carrying any embers from this fire down toward the south, since it is blowing out of the north. We're also still seeing some pretty good gusts around the rest of the region. But I wanted you to see some of the gusts that we're getting around the Palisades Fire. Look at the Santa Monica mountains Ridge top observation site, 69 mile per hour. Sustained winds gusting 98. So nearly 100 mile per hour. Wind gusts across some of our ridge tops. Right now, it's a little bit of a channeling effect that we're getting to, so it's helping to intensify some of the winds up there. Topanga beach, 38 mile per hour wind gusts. And we actually lost an observation site here in the Pacific Palisades area. Unsure if that's a power outage or if it was related to the fire itself, but we've added another one. It's over by Santa Monica at the airport itself. Right now, 21 mile per hour winds gusting to 51 miles an hour. So I just wanted to give that quick update on the winds again, potentially seeing gusts right now across some of our ridge tops into the 90 to 100 mile per hour range. Colleen. Yeah. Once again, when this is obviously the worst of it, when do you expect them to let up at all? Well, that's the hard part, because it looks like we might be looking at some of this well into the early morning, probably 2 or 3 a.m, but I was just looking through some of the forecast, trying to see what the updates are looking like. And we do have the potential to have it linger as late as 4 a.m, maybe 5 a.m. In a few spots. So it's really the next couple of hours. It's not going to be one of these things where we have this wind right now, and then it's gone and it's all going to get better. It's going to probably be like this for a while now and easily into the early morning, easily until at least 2 or 3:00 in the morning. And then it all depends on region for how late that's going to go. And then we have to wait until the afternoon before the winds overall let up. It's still going to be very windy through the morning, even if we're not getting wind gusts in the 50 to 100 mile per hour range, depending on location, we're still going to be seeing wind gusts in the 40 to 60 mile per hour range for a good chunk of the region well into the late morning and maybe even the early afternoon before the winds get lighter and by lighter. We're talking all relative here. We're talking about wind gusts in the 15 to 30 mile per hour range, which would be beneficial for firefighters. They would be able to work on some of this, but it is not beneficial in the sense that it's still pretty gusty out there. That's what we're looking at for the next few hours. So the message is, even if you think that things have calmed down just a bit, don't have that false. Don't live with that false sense of security. Exactly. We have to get through this overnight. First, it's going to be very gusty overnight. I'm sure a lot of people are going to wake up to the sound of the wind if they even go to bed tonight. So this is one of those things. Keep in mind, we've got this all night tonight. It's not until we get to tomorrow afternoon when you see the winds light up tomorrow afternoon. That is essentially it for now, until we get some additional winds coming our way for possibly Thursday night into Friday. All right. For now. Yeah. It's hard to even figure where the finish line is on this. Robert Kovacik. Is that we we're going to next. Okay. Robert Kovacik is covering the Palisades fire. Robert, give us an idea of where you are now. From what I can see, we're at Pompous Rica's and Frontera. This is still the Palisades area. We left you a short time ago on sunset at Fritz. We started heading east. We started to try and get to a safer area where we thought the fire would be less intense. But everywhere we turned, we saw situations like this which we're looking at a home right there, completely gone, completely engulfed in flames. We do see here East Fountain Valley Fire Department, as well as the Anaheim Fire Department here, Orange City Fire all down here. If it's structure protection or whateve, that home is completely lost. But they are surrounding this area because, again, the firestorm has just picked up even more. The gusts now are not even going to say their gusts anymore. Michael and Colleen, these are just strong, strong winds. Strong enough winds that they can push you over and strong enough winds that we have now seen that people who have not left are taking this seriously. There was a man at the home right here. We'll see if we can talk to him when he comes back out. He was watering his lawn. He was watering his roof. He was doing whatever he could. You know, you get into that mode that you think you can save your home. And someone from the fire department went to him and said, this isn't going to happen. This isn't going to work. We will do whatever we can to try and save your home, but you need to try and save yourself. And that is what this man apparently is doing. We saw a couple of other people honestly walking up the street like we saw a short time ago with that guy on a bicycle trying to get out of here. A little bit dazed. He was just sort of like, I'm. I guess I'm leaving, you know? It's just one of those things where, again, when you watch The Path of a fire, as we have watched for so long with so many different fires, the fire sort of does take a path and you feel once it gets it passes you on whatever journey that fire is going to take. Once it passes you, you feel as if you're out in the clear. You feel like those evacuation warnings, those mandatory evacuations, whatever you want to call them, are going to be lifted. Well, here in the Palisades, a community where the entire community was told to get out almost 12 hours ago, it hasn't changed. And honestly, it is only getting worse everywhere we have turned and we have been everywhere here in the Palisades. It right now is under siege. I'm going to let David show you this picture right now. I'm going to see if I can bother this man while he walks over there. Excuse me, sir. So you're leaving? Not yet. Can we chat with you while you do your stuff? You know, not really. What was your decision to finally say? It's time to get out. I'm not leaving yet. You're not leaving yet? No. You're going to see if you can stick this out. Well, until it turns worse. Yeah. I don't know how much worse it can get, but please be safe. It was a lot worse when that house was going up. So another house went up. So this. Yes, sir. Two of them went up. Two of them went up. Down here? Yeah. So you think you you could be spared from this? I hope so. Okay. Please be safe. Thank you. So the man just said. I'm not sure if you heard it due to the wind. He just said, I'm not leaving yet. I saw two homes go up already. My house is so far okay, but there's a house going up right there. Listen, this is. There is nowhere safe right now. And so the people that are staying here are certainly staying at their own risk. We have had firefighters come up and tell us where it is to be safe. We feel safe right here because we are flanked by them. We are following the guidelines of the fire department as as journalists. And we certainly suggest that residents here do the same. This is a very long night that is underway, as you all have said, the winds are only intensifying and they just keep getting worse and worse. And everywhere we go we just see fire. It's hopscotching. Now look right here. What do you mean by hopscotching, Robert? Well, just go right across the street. This is Fronteras here. There's another home right there on fire here at this intersection. Something we haven't seen before. And you see, this is a gentleman. I see there's a gentleman here who's walking, trying to get to his car, trying to get his belongings. Visibility is at zero. It is almost impossible to drive these streets. So when you try and get out, if you haven't already, you want to be very careful. David, let's take a little walk here. Being careful ourselves again. We have Fountain Valley fire here. We have Anaheim Fire Department here, and we are watching them try and do what they can. But again, this is a. Firefight that we're losing. And again, we have another house right here. Kahleah Michael, I don't know what street this is, so forgive me, but this house appears to be like it's going to be gone in just a matter of minutes. As we continue to watch the blaze here.
