What an eerie shot.
Now we just came out of Van Nuys Airport.
I think we're the first to be able to get up in
this wind and then also in
the temporary flight restriction because President Biden
is in town,
so we have to stay away from Century City,
but we have permission and we're headed now to the Eaton fire.
So we're basically just coming up on locking you out
of Frontage and we're looking to the east and boy,
look at that smoke come down the ridge line above Pasadena
and then roll down the hill past the 210 freeway.
You can see if we could bring up a sky map,
you see where the 2 freeway.
The 2 channel is and that sort of gives you
an idea and some perspective exactly where this fire is.
It started about 6:30 yesterday.
We understand 52,000 people are under a mandatory evacuation right now.
And if you start to look at this fire compared to what we have in the palisades,
the palisades has a break,
you know,
the winds are out of the north to the south,
and the Pacific Ocean is a break for that fire.
I can't go any further,
obviously,
but with this fire,
I think we have a lot of structures that are threatened.
I think this fire may be more difficult to contain in the
run because it continues to burn south.
It's going to get into an area of Glendale.
I understand I just got some information.
There are no evacuation orders yet in Glendale,
but that could come.
This is burning down towards Pasadena to the south side of Mount Wilson.
A lot of it up in that mountainous terrain,
but once it gets down to the bottom of the foothills,
all of those homes right now are threatened.
Now the winds have died down a little bit.
We're airborne.
That's proof of that,
and they'll be able,
but I tell you,
it's tough up here though.
The winds are pretty tough.
The aircraft should be able to get in here.
The hill.
Helicopters and make some drops.
I don't think the airplanes will be able to fly in this type of wind.
I don't think they will be effective,
the air tankers,
but the helicopters may be.
But we're having a tough time as it is.
This is a severe Santa Ana wind condition,
and we're just coming up on the fire now.
So we're going to continue to try and keep you updated as much as we can.
Once we get a little closer,
we'll really get a good look at what type of structure protection is in place
and then get a little better range of where this fire is headed.
But if it does get down to the areas of Glendale up.
To the east and west side of the two,
there are thousands of homes and they're nestled up in thick,
heavy brush.
They have brush surrounding them.
They have big trees.
They have heavy fuel,
and boy they are going to be extremely hard to defend,
and the winds are still very heavy in altitude.
We're about 5000 ft and we're having a tough time staying level.
So we're going to do our best to cover this from the air.
The winds may force us to return.
We're not sure yet,
but we're doing our best to try and get you a
real good perspective on just how bad these fires are.
Hey,
you wanna plug that address in real quick?
Oh.
OK,
well,
I know where it's at.
Well,
it looks like it's awful close to their house,
man.
Their house might be gone.
Oh no,
there's the 2,
that's them.
What is this?
Altadena,
you think?
I,
I think it is,
not Pasadena.
Pasadena?
Could it
Where are we going?
Yeah.
Yeah,
then I'd like to,
we might as well just get up over there.
Stick it into the wind and see if you can hover.
Just slow it down,
slow it way down and we'll just put around here and there.
So
All right.
OK,
uh,
SkyMap working?
lined up,
but
Can you show me what it looks like?
It's lined up,
but we can use it here.
Can we uh
Can I don't think we need to do satellite on this.
OK,
cool,
cool.
Yeah,
yeah.
I see it?
Where was he?
Yeah,
it's sad.
We see several homes that are going to be lost here,
and it wouldn't surprise me if almost all the homes in this area off of Chapman Court,
Little Canyon Lane are going to be lost.
It hopscotches from one home to the next,
but there's not enough structure protection in here
to really try and save all of these homes.
It's really going to be a struggle.
Now I want to come out and give you a little perspective where we're at.
We're just to the north and the east side of JPL,
right along the 210 freeway,
right on the border of Pasadena and all.
Dina and there's a freeway on the right.
There's the 210.
So as far as Glendale is concerned,
I believe there are some evacuation orders in place,
but they are not mandatory.
But I certainly believe that is going to happen because
that area to the right side of your screen,
that is Glendale,
the northern portion of Glendale,
but right now the battle is on the ridge line on the foothills here,
and you can see all the homes in here and you
can see the flames just coming up over this heavy fuel.
There's a home there that's going to be lost.
There's several.
Other homes that we've seen probably a half dozen or more,
and they're just going to be so tough to save
because of the winds,
you know,
the winds are right now unpredictable.
We get a smooth patch and then all of a sudden we get hammered up here.
We're up at 6500 ft
on the north side of this fire.
It's all burning to the south.
Obviously the winds are out of the north,
the Santa Anna.
I want to give you a wide shot because this fire is huge.
I know we've got 2200 plus reported.
It's going to be,
in my opinion,
more than double that.
That's Almost to Mount Wilson.
That's the area on the top of your screen.
I think we can go to satellite view and maybe show you just north of Pasadena.
So it looks like it's going to burn down into that area.
You see where the 2100 merges down and then the 210 freeway right there.
That's Pasadena.
That's like downtown Pasadena proper.
and we open up a little bit out of that shot,
you'll see all the smoke
and you'll see the area that they have to defend.
So if you have respiratory problems,
this smoke is all the way down towards the eastern.
Edge of the San Fernando Valley downtown Los Angeles,
you're just getting inundated with all this unhealthy air.
You have to stay inside,
of course the 2 is shut down,
excuse me,
the 210 is shut down.
It looks like a portion of the 2 remains open.
Most of this is burning to the east side of the 2.
So for those folks that live right along the 2 freeway and the 210 right now,
it's pushed more towards the Altadena and the Pasadena area and what
would be the eastern edge of Loing out of Flint Ridge.
But these are sad sights.
And we've seen so many,
so much of this,
you know,
in the last year and then now again in 2025.
This is heartbreaking.
I feel for these people.
I don't know where the fatalities were.
I understand.
I heard a bit of the report from getting airborne
that two people may have been killed in this fire.
This once again is the Eaton fire,
but it's going to be extremely difficult for firefighters to save these homes.
These hot embers get under the attic and get in there and
all of a sudden the home is just going to be lost.
Do have structure protection.
You can see it in place there.
I believe there are helicopters in this area making drops.
Some of the big tankers,
I don't think we're going to see the air tankers,
the airplanes making retardant drops until the wind dies down.
I think the wind is going to be a little too difficult for that,
but certainly the helicopters are going to do the best they can.
But with this fire burning,
the other fire,
the Palisades fire raging out of control,
I've got to look at the Hearst fire,
which is up in Silmar.
That did lay down pretty nicely from what I could tell.
So of the two,
this one I believe is going to be the most difficult fire to contain
the Palisades fire,
that's been heartbreaking as well.
We've lost a lot of homes out there.
I think Gabe is headed that direction and he's going
to be overhead and show us some of that.
Certainly unfortunately that's going to be devastating as well.
But once again,
just to let you know that's Chapman Court to the left side of your screen.
That's Little Canyon Lane where that home is burning,
and it's just sad to watch all these homes go up.
Well,
we haven't seen a helicopter yet.
Now,
we're up pretty high,
uh,
but I did,
I thought I heard someone on the ground say they heard an aircraft fly over.
I sincerely doubt that was an airplane.
Um.
I'm not sure.
Have you lost me?
Do you have my signal back?
OK,
as far as the helicopters concerned,
I believe that they're spread out.
I do believe that the water dropping helicopters are now able to fly.
We haven't seen them on this fire yet,
so I'm not certain exactly where they're at,
uh,
but you know,
when you have so much of an exposure,
you have all these homes they're in Eaton Canyon.
A lot of it you can't get to because of the smoke.
You got the Palisades fire and you have helicopters responding there,
and they're really just getting up and running right now.
I think we're going to start to see a lot of them.
But right now they just got clearance to fly
because the wind has died down a little bit
and once again unfortunately there is the possibility that we're just getting
a lull in the winds and they're going to kick up once again
and then we're going to have to go back and they won't be able to drop.
In some cases if it's too windy,
they're just not effective
and it's too risky,
and then they'll go back to their base.
But the last we heard is that the helicopters
are going to get up and start making drops,
although I have not seen one on this fire yet.
OK,
copy.
Thank you.
Well,
these things,
yeah,
these things take time.
They're trying to get the aircrafts up,
but it just takes time.
Jay was just giving me some information and he can sit at the desk.
And you can actually pull up the transponder code for any aircraft that is up,
and we are one of only two,
and I don't know what the other one is.
It could be an air attack sort of assessing the situation and
deciding where they're going to focus the attention of the helicopters,
but right now we're the only helicopter we can tell up over the fire.
As far as the water dropping helicopters,
we believe they're in the stands right now where they're getting ready.
To respond to the fire
to both this one and the Palisades fire,
but I thought I had heard a reporter on the
ground say that an airplane or a helicopter flew over.
I don't believe that was the case because there's really the only helicopter
I could tell that's up over this Eaton fire right now is.
And I'm not sure how long we'll be able to stay because the winds are pretty tough.
We're battling them the best we can.
It's not unsafe.
Uh,
it really isn't.
I've never heard of too many helicopters
crashing when they're airborne with high winds,
but
landing can be another story.
So if the winds are too high.
We can have difficulty shutting the helicopter down.
That could be a risk,
and we have to keep
monitoring the wind gusts because those are what will get us.
But right now we're doing just fine.
Sadly though,
we just watched these homes burn.
You could see the firefighters are getting a heavy stream of water on that house.
We see about 4 or 5 that have been lost,
but we also see a lot more homes that are.
Threatened.
And when you look at this area right here,
this is just north of JPL.
Pull out of your shot just a little bit if you would for me,
Marcel,
off to the right side of the screen,
that's down towards the JPL.
It's off a little bit right there,
right to the right.
There it is right there on the right side of your screen is JPL.
Now you can tell from there as we pan the left,
the real risk some of those homes are in a residential area.
And their development.
The homes that are development are much easier to protect
than the homes down along these ridge lines.
Some of these other homes in which they are just have heavy fuel surrounding them.
As a fire burns this way,
it's going to be very difficult to protect those once
those hot embers get on some of that heavy brush,
that heavy fuel
next to those homes in there.
You could tell how Difficult that is to protect
compared to if we tilt up with the camera a little bit,
we got a little a little smoke in there compared to
protecting that home there you can have easy access to that.
There's a residential home.
It's a track.
There's one home right next to the right next to each other,
and they can get on it quickly.
But when the fire moves down into some of that area that's much more wood.
It's really going to be a difficult task and right now without the helicopters up,
they're just battling Mother Nature.
You see a little spot fire that started right there and then all of a sudden
that spreads to the attic and all of a sudden to an eaves to the attic,
and then that home is on fire.
On a home is on fire,
it's extremely difficult for them to put that out.
Can you tell me what street that is,
Marcel?
Can we see that on Sky Map?
North old.
Pole Road,
uh,
there's that little road right there where we have the little smoke in the backyard.
That other road,
there's,
there's sky maps,
so that gives you an idea.
You see Chapman Court,
you see,
uh,
I think that's Lilac Canyon if I'm not mistaken,
in North Old Pole Road.
So that whole area right now is certainly um
in.
Danger of being lost.
You can see a couple of fire crews there,
but in a lot of cases when you have enough support,
you'll see a fire engine in front of every single home and we don't see that.
We don't see enough support right here from,
in my opinion,
and Marcel knows better than I,
but what do you think about that,
Marcel as far as enough engines there?
They're stretched,
so they're really stretched on resources.
Marcel was a fireman for 20 years,
so he really has great insight on that.
So if these other homes start to go,
they just don't have enough resources to really hop on them,
and you could tell it's still extremely windy,
winds aloft up here probably about 50 to 60 knots,
I would say,
because we're showing almost nothing on the air speed at this
point or 40 on the air speed and we're not moving.
Uh,
but this is really the risk,
uh,
this area down in here,
once we get down towards,
uh,
there's more of this wooded area,
more of the heavy brush,
more of those trees,
we have more hot embers and then that spreads further south.
I'd like to give you a wide shot because I mentioned once before,
I think I heard
an update on acres of around 2,200+.
But certainly I think once we get an aircraft up to fly around this
and give us the acreage,
it appears to me it's much larger than that,
so we will have to see,
but look at all that unhealthy air that's going right down over Pasadena,
right down towards Alhambra,
downtown Los Angeles,
and so that that unhealthy air.
Really is the kind of thing if you have respiratory problems,
just stay in the house.
I mean,
shut the windows,
stay in the house because this is really putting a lot of embers up into the air,
a lot of particulates.
It's really unhealthy,
especially if you have respiratory problems.
Now firefighters have been able to at least keep the fire to just that one home,
but certainly you could tell they're all at risk,
serious risk.
We got a 2nd 1 there?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Airplane
OK,
yeah.
OK,
a hello tanker.
Interesting,
OK.
If you start feeling uncomfortable,
you don't wanna fly,
don't feel bad about it,
right?
It's your call completely 100%.
Yeah
Uh,
they do,
you know,
I mean,
you want your home to look beautiful,
right?
You plant some nice big trees and then we have,
uh,
no rain for what,
8 months,
and then we have these winds kick up and everything is so dry,
it just goes up so quickly,
and we have several homes here.
You see that one on the top of your screen now?
We didn't have flames shooting out the top of that home a moment ago,
and you can see all the smoke.
So these homes are just going to be extremely difficult
to protect.
There's no question about that.
I'm more concerned.
I think they'll save these homes.
Everybody's out of this area from what I can tell,
the evacuations are been in full force in this area since early yesterday,
or I should say late yesterday afternoon.
I think this fire broke out around 6:30.
And uh boy it just completely came down the hill so quickly with these winds.
It was nearly impossible to try and protect all of this,
but
this residential area,
that tract right there,
certainly we're going to lose a lot of homes there.
But if it gets down a little further south and it gets down towards
some of those homes that are wooded and a lot of lot of wood,
a lot of growth around them,
I mean if you're familiar with Pasadena at
the north end of Pasadena up towards Altadena,
if it's Starts headed down in that area and that's really where it is right in there.
We just can't see it through the smoke.
You have so many of those old homes,
those beautiful old homes,
and they're nestled up in huge trees,
row after row after row.
And once those start,
it's going to be really difficult to save those homes.
I'd like to give you a wide shot as wide
as I can once again because the perspective is eerie.
Now we're basically over the 2 and the 210 north of that.
On the southern edge of the Angeles National Forest and we're looking east,
so Mount Wilson is off the left side of your screen.
The fire is burning from the north to the south.
It's burning down towards Pasadena.
You don't have a lot of information right now.
It's pretty scattered,
but I believe this fire has burned its way into Pasadena and those homes there.
There you see,
right in there.
Can you get a satellite view for me,
Marcel?
Because if we see on the satellite view,
once we push in there,
all of these homes in here,
they're older homes.
They have a lot of um.
Of growth around them and it's going to be extremely difficult to save
those in these types of winds once it gets down into that area.
So that's the battle right now.
As far as the aircrafts are concerned,
we're still waiting for the helicopters.
We do understand there may be a hea tanker or even an air tanker en route to this fire.
We just heard something about that also over the Palisades fire where Josh is.
We understand there's an air attack aircraft up,
so the air attack is up right now assessing the situation and trying to figure.
Out exactly where they're going to send the resources.
They put together a plan and then they'll send the
helicopters in and then hopefully they'll send in the tankers.
Now the tankers,
the hea tankers,
we talk about them,
but when we talk about the air tankers,
they dropped the FOSS check and they are so critical
in surrounding a fire and stopping the fire from growing.
There's one thing the battle of the fire
itself and firefighters first and foremost trying to save
lives and then trying to save the homes and
the helicopters will aid in saving those homes.
They'll drop right on the flames.
The tankers.
The air tankers for the most part are dropping FOSE around the outside of the fire,
and they're allowing firefighters to say,
OK,
we've got a FOScheck line over there.
We can put our resources somewhere else.
We really don't think the fire is going to spread,
let's say to the east or to the north.
We've got a handle on that.
We can just focus on where the fire is headed right now and then with that they
can they can get a plan together on exactly how they're going to use their resources.
But boy we need those helicopters.
We really,
if you remember when we saw was it the Franklin fire,
the That burned in Malibu just a bit ago.
Remember when we saw the night that it broke out,
it just consumed so much
and it got into those homes.
But the next morning the wind died down and we had like 8 helicopters,
the big helicopters,
making water drops,
and that was the difference between losing a couple of homes
and losing a couple 100 homes because they could get in
there and they could stop that fire before right down into
Malibu where you had so many homes that were threatened.
Today,
unfortunately this fire is so big.
Both of them combined
that we're spreading our resources so thin we just don't have enough helicopters
to send it to,
you know,
both fires and make a huge difference.
And so they're going to do the best that they can with what they have.
The wind certainly is the big factor here.
It's a wind driven fire.
We see this home on the top of your screen that just took off.
You see the home in the middle of your shot,
that's on fire.
That's going to be lost.
They're trying to knock that down as best as they can because once you get inside,
a fire starts consuming a.
Home,
there's a lot of fuel in there and of course there's a lot
of embers in there and those are thick embers that could travel,
you know,
a mile and then start a spot fire somewhere else.
So they really want to try and do the best they can but they only have
one engine there it looks like that has the ability to get water
on that home and right now they're just hoping it
doesn't spread to others tilt up a little bit.
That home looks lost right there in the middle.
On the top of your screen there's another home.
I believe this was Chapman Court,
if I'm not mistaken.
There's another home that was lost.
Lilac Canyon Lane actually there's another home that is lost,
and all of these homes are immediately threatened because they
really don't have enough resources to protect them all.
So,
it's a sad day.
It's been a sad couple of days.
These fires,
they're heartbreaking,
and I feel for these folks.
I had a couple burned right up to my home.
I know what it's like to be evacuated.
Um,
and but that's a struggle as well,
and then I know what it's like to try and find a place to go.
You know what happens when you have this many evacuations if
you don't have a family member to go live with,
you got to go to a hotel and guess what?
You start checking the hotels and they're all booked
and you have to travel a long ways to find one that,
that,
that happened to me.
In the Woolsey fire.
So we're just keeping an eye on it from the air,
but unfortunately what we're seeing right now does not look good.
We're going to have a long couple of days ahead of us.
It's going to be a real struggle until the winds die down.
If the winds die down,
if we could just get a day with little to no wind,
I think they'll make some progress.
But in the meantime,
this is going to be extremely tough.
