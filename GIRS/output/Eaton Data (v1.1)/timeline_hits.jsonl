It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.\nI had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."}

Year after year, communities are decimated while Newsom pours billions into ridiculous vanity projects—like the bullet train to nowhere—instead of addressing the very real and urgent safety needs of the people he’s supposed to serve. While he chases headlines, Californians are left with nothing but ashes and shattered lives.\n\nPractical solutions—like widening fire roads to ensure safer evacuations and creating temporary refuge areas for displaced families—have been sitting on the table for decades. Decades. And what has Newsom done? Nothing. His inaction, despite over 25 years of clear warnings, is not just negligent; it’s outright disgraceful.\n\nEven worse, critical public safety funding continues to be deprioritized. Seven months before the uncontrolled Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, the city's fire department budget for this fiscal year was slashed by more than $17.5 million, according to records. Instead of strengthening frontline defenses, resources are being diverted elsewhere. Mayor Karen Bass, in signing the City of Los Angeles' budget for the 2024-2025 fiscal year, further highlighted how misplaced priorities are contributing to the wildfire crisis.\n\nTo the families who have lost everything—your homes, your loved ones, your futures—you deserve leaders who actually care about your survival, not ones obsessed with their political legacy. Newsom’s empty promises and grossly misplaced priorities show a staggering disregard for the very people he was elected to protect.\n\nGovernor Newsom, your failure is killing people. Californians are dying, and you’re too busy grandstanding to do anything meaningful. Stop ignoring basic common sense. Stop wasting time and resources on pipe dreams. Start doing your job—or step aside for someone who will. FK I can do a better job! Enough is enough."}
