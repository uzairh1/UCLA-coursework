I wanted to see if the evacuation order in my area was lifted, instead I found, 
“Eaton Fire Repopulation Zone Viewer”, 3 days into the fire. 😳

Please look it up for yourself!

Why would the city title this “Repopulation Viewer” instead of evacuation viewer???

Something nefarious is going on!!!!

And the city is in on it, along with greedy gruesome!"

Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-12T08:02:05Z,0,"Not enough people fighting the fire when it's just a small bush fire around the house -- all ran away and it's impossible to rely on the limit firefighters to save their houses. People should develope a plan, prepared to stay and help put out the small fire around the yard before it burned the house and became 100' tall fire. Stucco wall and tile roof won't catch fire easy. It needs  human or robot to fight the small fires, not the fire Dept.
This area are new big beautiful houses."

God bless America"
Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-09T01:17:57Z,4,"If the fires get much worse I hope the insurance companies can cover all the losses.  I heard some people say there were houses that cost upwards of $10 million but there were also cases of houses that had their insurance policies canceled due to fire risk.  It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.
I had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."

Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-08T22:59:19Z,33,Just learned that a co-worker lost his home in Altadena and another friend has evacuated his family from their 1st home. It's just heartbreaking
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-08T22:08:17Z,14,"My mother's in assisted living in Arcadia and I know they evacuated half of Arcadia. Her facility's been without electricity for a day now and she's on the 2nd floor and can't use the elevator. The phones aren't working at the facility and my mom's phone lost battery so I can't get in contact and I'm watching all of this from New Jersey. I just hope they contain this fire before it comes down the mountain to the surrounding buildings even more.

Growing up in Southern California in the San Gabriel Valley, I recall seeing fires in the mountains every summer but they were always contained and never came down the mountains. Now it's seems like they are so powerful and devastating and he's right, it's really dry there now, more so then I remember as a child in the 70's and 80s."

Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-08T23:11:46Z,0,"Guarantee half the people driving on these streets have no business being there and are just slowing down those who do need to be there and also consuming resources (fuel) and setting themselves up to be one more person in trouble needing assistance. Yes, many are trying to evacuate and that's legit, but most are just lookylous getting in the way. I'd like to blame it on ""California idiots"" but this really does happen everywhere. I only worked emergency relief once long ago and am not a professional by any means, but I am intelligent enough to know that all I am likely to contribute in such a situation is to make things worse, so I stay home and watch on YouTube (unless I needed to evacuate and, hopefully, I had the means to do so before it was too late)."

They were inquiring how many of the half dozen care homes and the main hospital  had extra beds.  The nursing home up there was evacuating out the front door as the fire was b urning the back part.

I miss my Uncle George (RIP) but I'm glad he didn't have to see this devastation. 

Anyone that's lived in Altadena/Pasadena for any length of time is probably familiar with my Uncle George (he was always in the local newspapers). 
He was the boys basketball coach for Pasadena High School & then Pasadena Community College. 
He's also in the Pasadena Sports Hall of Fame.

It didn't matter if it was 90°.  
At Christmas when we'd gather in the living room to open presents, Uncle George would get in the Christmas Spirit! 
He'd wear a Christmas Sweater and build a fire in the fireplace (which was funny when the rest of us were wearing tank tops & shorts LOL).

I have 61 years of memories, good times & holidays spent in that house.

Palisades Fire,evacuation,2025-01-12T00:16:02Z,1,"Newsom has utterly failed to protect Californians from the ever-worsening wildfire crisis. Year after year, communities are decimated while Newsom pours billions into ridiculous vanity projects—like the bullet train to nowhere—instead of addressing the very real and urgent safety needs of the people he’s supposed to serve. While he chases headlines, Californians are left with nothing but ashes and shattered lives.

Practical solutions—like widening fire roads to ensure safer evacuations and creating temporary refuge areas for displaced families—have been sitting on the table for decades. Decades. And what has Newsom done? Nothing. His inaction, despite over 25 years of clear warnings, is not just negligent; it’s outright disgraceful.

Even worse, critical public safety funding continues to be deprioritized. Seven months before the uncontrolled Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, the city's fire department budget for this fiscal year was slashed by more than $17.5 million, according to records. Instead of strengthening frontline defenses, resources are being diverted elsewhere. Mayor Karen Bass, in signing the City of Los Angeles' budget for the 2024-2025 fiscal year, further highlighted how misplaced priorities are contributing to the wildfire crisis.

To the families who have lost everything—your homes, your loved ones, your futures—you deserve leaders who actually care about your survival, not ones obsessed with their political legacy. Newsom’s empty promises and grossly misplaced priorities show a staggering disregard for the very people he was elected to protect.

Governor Newsom, your failure is killing people. Californians are dying, and you’re too busy grandstanding to do anything meaningful. Stop ignoring basic common sense. Stop wasting time and resources on pipe dreams. Start doing your job—or step aside for someone who will. FK I can do a better job! Enough is enough."

Palisades Fire,notification,2025-01-17T16:34:45Z,0,"Very sad news for all of us but as 
A wise perspective! Indeed, calamities and misfortunes can serve as a wake-up call, guiding individuals toward the right path. The Quran mentions that Allah sends trials and tribulations to test humanity's faith and righteousness.

The ongoing wildfires in LA, and other natural disasters, can be seen as a reminder of Allah's power and authority. They encourage us to reevaluate our priorities, seek forgiveness, and strive for righteousness.
so these events can be a source of guidance for those who have neglected the true path. Allah's mercy and forgiveness are always available, and it's never too late to seek redemption and follow the path of righteousness.

May these trials serve as a catalyst for spiritual growth, and may Allah guide us all toward the right path. Ameen!"

Resorts, hotels, star restaurants, shopping centers, markets, entertainment centers, bars, parks, lawns, the beauty of trees, plants and vines are all charred and melted. 

Business and industry have all come to a standstill. People have also evacuated the town.

Henceforth, no matter how many billions the US government spends and rebuilds that city, it is doubtful whether people will be able to go to that city and live with the warmth of nature and its protection !!! 

Even if the lands and properties costing crores are now available for free, the people will no longer want to live there.  They have seen the fury and terror of nature. 

A human being like a mosquito can't give any guarantee that something like this would not happen again in the future.  😮😢😮"

Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-23T06:56:56Z,3,I'm disappointed that you think it's that easy to notify everybody when a fire is moving that fast... Do you honestly think that people always get evacuation orders in time? Because that's literally not how any of this works.
Eaton Fire,notification,2025-01-23T06:49:27Z,6,"They didn’t get notice and all of Los Angeles county got a false notification .  I received a second false notification at 3:30 something AM - probably was the same one that was too late for Altadena.  I’m roughly 25 miles away from Altadena Somebody at the switchboard needs to be replaced along with BASS AND NEWSOM!
Pathetic!!!"
Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-09T21:59:19Z,0,"I don't understand... were they not prepared in case the fire came to them? How do evacs work in these types of situations? Poor animals. GOD bless the lady who said she wouldn't leaver her babies. It's hard for some to understand that for some people, their animals ARE their family, and for a part of those, their ONLY family. Praying they get the help they need since Trump said he was pulling funding from wildfire fighting agencies, and now the fire departments have been defunded for the police----no state should have to give the much needed funds for both to one or the other. Well...I hope CA can make it through this. They have made it through many."

You can show footage of the fire without putting this reporter and her team in danger. She’s inhaling smoke on air! There’s embers blowing around her hair. That’s insane. Slowing down the evacuation and creating a possible situation that will further endanger firefighters? This was SO Irresponsible."

Eaton Fire,notification,2025-01-22T18:45:53Z,4,"Why would you rely on this government for warnings , orders , alerts , and admonishments ?"
Eaton Fire,notification,2025-02-15T15:51:50Z,0,"Thank you for reporting on this! This is one of the few actual news stories coming from the Industrial L.A. Fire News Coverage Complex. (I'm thinking of footage of the same streets and same scenes of the same houses burning day after day, calling it ""updates"" and ""breaking news"" when it clearly was not!) Jose and others are doing what Law Enforcement and L.A. Bureaucrats should be doing but are not."
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-21T12:51:26Z,1,This wouldn’t be an issue if they had ***** listened to the evacuation orders and left in the first place. They’re more than welcome to leave if they need supplies.
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-19T17:24:01Z,0,I’d be doing the same exact thing in a mandatory evacuation but you can’t expect others to risk staying during an evacuation for supplies. You don’t want a bunch of vehicles coming and going… that’s how looters go unchecked. Everyone CAN stay if they want but they won’t force you to leave. The evacuation is mandatory though so they don’t want people out and about there. Less and less people will heed the evacuation and more people would die
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-19T01:44:48Z,0,"Imagine staying behind in an evacuation area knowing full well that resources would be scarce, if any, and then complaining about that very same thing happening. They understood the risks and made the choice to stay. Now suffer the consequences of your own choices and actions. Darwin awards need to be handed out more often."
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-18T14:23:19Z,0,"I live in NJ and a year or 2 back the forest fires in Canada greatly affected the air quality where I live . Sut and debri was everywhere. On our cars, blacktop, glass tables and in the air. This went on for weeks. School recess was held indoors because it was not safe to go outside and breathe the air. I remember walking to my car and there is a gray haze everywhere. The local gov suggested for people to wear masks outside. Mind you, we are not talking about 15-20 miles away for the fires. Canada is not a stones through away from where I live 

If one come put two into together, staying in these areas are a safety hazard. If you’re not affected today, you will be affected tomorrow. There are microscopic particles in the air that you are constantly breathing in from these toxic fires. People evacuate."
Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-18T05:59:49Z,0,"Same thing they did in Hawaii and NC. Just shady. I don’t know what it’s going to take before people start preparing emergency supplies. None of my friends or family are listening. Everyone just going about their days as if these things can’t and won’t ever touch them where they live. I used to think the “peppers” were crazy. Not anymore. What is it going to take for people to see the writing on the wall. Everyone should be prepared to be in their home with no utilities and no way to get more food and supplies from the stores, and also prepared to grab a bag and go. I don’t know what else folks have to see to wake up."
Eaton Fire,notification,2025-01-18T01:58:46Z,0,At least the news is airing this ..They didn’t even do that here in Western North Carolina..Ppl still living in tents who lost homes
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-17T23:06:35Z,1,"The reason is clear. Because you didn't follow the order. No one should have been allowed to bring you anything, and you shouldn't have been allowed to leave your home until streets are re-opened. That's how it works in Florida when people defy mandatory evacuation orders for a hurricane."
Eaton Fire,notification,2025-01-17T15:13:40Z,2,What is wrong with authorities .. why are they pushing people out of their homes? this makes no sense . newscast needs to ask these questions of those in charge.
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-17T11:00:27Z,1,"It is obvious that most of the comments here are not from people who have ever lived through any type of natural disaster.

Law enforcement and officials have the responsibility for the community at large and houses that go up and smoke are nothing compared to lives lost of people stay their ground or a home that is looted because people are able to enter the zone. I have lived in both NorCal and SoCal in both in San Francisco with earthquakes and in Santa Monica with issues like this week, as homeowners, take our chances but we are also prepared and we listen to evacuation orders. 

*This anti-government ""do not comply"" stuff is for the birds.*"
Eaton Fire,preparation,2025-01-17T07:42:31Z,0,May this serve as a lesson to ALL Americans. The government isn’t coming to save you. The government isn’t here to support you even after a natural disaster. STOP depending or relying on these tyrants. LEARN to be self sufficient. Be PREPARED for the worst! Buy generators before they are needed. Learn how to collect and store rain water. Buy solar panels and batteries. It’s time everybody WAKES TF UP. Start being self sufficient!!!!

Literally all they need are some traffic cones and a stop sign or two but the city wont even let them set up.

I really dont know how to feel about this whole thing because on one hand they voted for these politicians and policies on the other this situation keeps getting worse."
Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-17T00:36:13Z,1,"I understand why the police don't want people coming in because they could open up the neighborhood to looters, but if people have IDs and there's a city / police officer presence at the entrance, couldn't that solve the problem? I think what could be done (in the future) is have a handful of people in the community OR the city leadership to be community reps. These reps could also know who the elderly/disabled are (in each neighborhood) and be the contact to help get these people out when evacuations are called for (they would know who they are)."

Eaton Fire,evacuation,2025-01-11T02:59:56Z,1,"I have two family friends they were able to save their houses by using garden hose. They were prepared with mask, fire prof jackets and small portable oxygen tanks. they teamed up went to the roof and spray water all over their surroundings and stop one small tiny fire at a time. The they simply focus to guard one direction and move from time to time to other spot. The intense part only lasted 4-5 hours and when the smokes clear the fire next door are small and manageable.. The fire in the residential area was cause by small embers that are managable. If people only people calm down and guard their houses with water, the damage should be less. Men should guard their homes while women evacuate cause they would only cry, shout and panic. Most importantly I think the panic warnings to evacuate early made by the authority did the real damage."
