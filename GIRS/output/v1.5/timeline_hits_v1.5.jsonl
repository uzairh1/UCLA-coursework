First off, forest fires are unusual in our area, especially in early spring. However,we didn't get much snow over the winter,so forests were unnaturally dry. Thousands of acres were lost, hundreds of homes and businesses wiped out😢 NOT once did politics enter the discussion! NOT once!! Both areas destroyed were a mix of lower income and very wealthy,yet that had no bearing on anything. EVERYONE was treated as equals,everyone pulled together to help. There were no conspiracy theories,there were no lies being spread by the news. Not once were politics mentioned. No hate,no lies,just hope and help. The cause was determined after thorough investigation to be an older lady burning garbage in one area and teens having a bonfire in a other. No lasers,no government interference,just human error. Why does it seem that every disaster in the Divided States recently is shrouded in hate,false news and political strife?? Shouldn't kindness, generosity and support of all people be the most important thing?? The future looks sad for AmeriKKKa 💔"}

I just watched a video 2days ago.. where a girl names Molly Burke who is blind, was at a park with her boyfriend making short little videos of their day for youtube, she has her own channel and she said that while she was there a electrical transformer blew up and blue flames came of it and wires were sparking. And as they were leaving the fire department was coming up to deal with the issue. Now...during this video she had with her bf minutes before they said that happened there was little to no wind and as soon as they got home they say smoke and the fires were inching closer to their home. And they got a flight out to her parents house and as soon as they landed their neighbor called to tell them that the a rea they live in was under evacuation orders. Again... No wind but electrical in the area blew up. Is it possible because Idk how thise wires are made and how they work. Is it possible to make these things blow up intentionally? Because its a little too coincidentalnthat these things even in no wind just explode all in the same time frame."}

That will stop this Type of fire from destroying major parts of your life.\n\nWhile we all hear of the boss, and we see the other destruction, imagine the pain and sense of frustration when these people are handed their next mortgage payment. Another widely ignored issue in this situation are all of the Tesla power walls and other battery storage devices the green new generation have embraced. Each of those destroyed batteries, and even some of the solar panels will require a hazardous materials, clean up and endorsement prior to any rebuilding. Much of the expense in the hundreds of thousands for that type of cleanup will sit on the shoulders of the owners as it’s not covered by their home owners policy in mostcase cases. My heart goes out for all of these people affected.\n\nHere is another afterthought for you all to consider. At @AP @APNews has, anyone considered the potential damage in injury and consequences of our first responders, breathing all of these melted batteries from home storage cells, and even EV’s that have been destroyed. For many, this is a nightmare that was seen in the burn pits 😊 although on steroids because we are burning a much wider group of toxins in these residential and commercialbuildings smoldering now."}

The higher up the hill I drove the more destruction I witnessed.\n\nIt’s an older neighborhood and I witnessed many classic cars of all types burned to a crisp. Fire melts automobile alloy wheels and glass into puddles. As a “car guy” it was sad to witness so many Porsches, Jeeps, classic pickups, old Cadillac’s, desirable short-bed Chevy C-10’s, etc. destroyed. \n\nFire spares nothing except ceramic pots and shower tile. Even steel gets warped from the heat. I feel bad for the residents and all of the future insurance headaches the owners will have to deal with IF they are insured. \n\nI can’t imagine anyone surviving the raging inferno at its peak. The FD found one body during my shift and they were waiting for the coroner who refused to come up due to safety concerns."}

County ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION that was first set off in a small, negligently mismanaged, North Pasadena neighborhood called Eaton Canyon.\r\n\r\nWhy did the government functionally cause the fringe neighborhood of Altadena to burn to the ground?  There remained just too many housing units there that continued to qualify for the cheapest property tax rates as mandated by the State of California's 1978 Proposition 13!  In one fell, who-could'a thunkit swoop and as a consequence of the ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION, more than 2/3rds of those Proposition 13-qualifying homes have burned down or otherwise unrecoverably been damaged. \r\n\r\nWhen homeowners rebuild, the State of California -- in backstabbing fashion -- will declare all Prop' 13 covered fire rebuilds to ALL be NEW STRUCTURES.  This means all new tax-standards, and that Prop' 13's 1978 tax break has suddenly become functionally extinct.  All this is because the Satanic threesome of the State, the County, and the City of Pasadena conspired to ignore their fire-abatement duties, leading to the wholesale burn out of all them tax-avoiding property-owners.\r\n\r\nPasadena is also going to make a grab at incorporating Altadena into Pasadena as a coopted tax-base.  That's the major reason it cooperated so completely with this community burn-out conspiracy.  With all them condemned properties being wholly unlivable, the former residents of those homes will now be former voters of Altadena.  This will make it so much cheaper for the City of Pasadena to bribe-out the remaining residents to sell cheap to the City's incorporation process."}

Blaming Internal Combustion Engine  Petrol Vehicles.  To Push Power Grid Draining Appliances and Flame throwing Electric Vehicles ( EV's). 2 Days ago State Contractors came to my house trying to sell me Electric Water Heater. I told them 90 % of the city was out of Power not even a Red Lights Blinking on intersections in the streets. My Heater.  Biden Making Electric Water Heater, and Stoves is the Dumbest Idea..

The EPA will Blame Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle's... While not including these types of events... Some of the Missouri Granulated Lithium-ion Fredericktown Recycling Fire has reached Los Angeles California. Thanks to Santa Ana winds. I took a Shower and had the Black MASS in and around my ear after fight 100 mph Winds to cover my car. Winds Blew smoke away from where i live and Large Sand Stones 1/8 to 1/4 inch diameter. Those 1st 2 days the Black MASS was fueling the fires. ( Speculation on this sentence of course ) Keep buying them Flame Throwing EV cars. Possible cause... Look up 2008 to 2011 Recession in San Diego. The Homes in 2006 were valued FROM $125,000 TO $250,000... WITH Flipping of Values in the years that followed. Then in September 16, 2008 Bubble Burst... in 2009 I had a Social Studies Class and the Professor Who Bashed on George W. Bush for not sending Help immediately, to Katrina. While he approved immediate help for the San Diego Community. The Professor claimed President Bush was Ra4ci5t, for \"helping San Diego a predominantly {White ( his word.: not saying Caucasian ) }. While Louisiana New Orleans community getting Assistants 4 to 5 Days from when Floods started.. I Raised my hand to when he Identified Bush as R***st. He said you what's on your mind. I said your talking about 2 different scenarios. Katrina was the Largest Hurricane at the Time, and winds 100 mph with 150 mph gusts,,, The Hurricane was moving slowly, traveling North East. In those Flooded Conditions, First responders Firemen, police couldn't help their own Families, let alone their Community. People were in the Attics and Roofs of their homes, for 7 days when News choppers from other states, because the winds tipped over or destroyed, after hurricane passed. I mentioned Big Rigs tip over at 60 mph, and the Hurricane still traveling thru states surrounding Louisiana. Big Rigs from FEMA would not make to Football Stadium 10 to 25 miles away from Flooded Communities. Flood Victims were not going to Swim in Murky Waters for 10 to 25 miles. In San Diego the Communities Packed their Vehicles and were able to DRIVE to the Football Stadium. within 4 hours for 54,000 + people to commute the Winds were not as bad .

When I arrived at home in the West side of Altadena, my entire neighborhood was long already evacuated except for one other neighbor. I was ready to live or died fighting this fire. There was a house in back of my house that was fully on fire. I grab my water hose and walk up to my back yard fence to Feight the fire that was getting close to my area of the fence. Turn on the hose to find out I had very little water pressure. Of what I had I had to work with it. I managed to control the fire progression down to my side of the fence. But on the other side of my neighbor's property, the fire progress to another house (Ventura side). When the fire progress to the next-door house I decided to make a stand and jump their fence to use their water hose to save their house (Ventura side). Turn on their hose and to find out they had absolutely no water pressure. What the hell is going on. There is a huge water storage tank on Harriet near Glen Ave. and a pumping station on olive (this building was not effective by the fire). We always had major windstorms where we lost power for 7 days and still, we had water pressure. With low water pressure I lost the battle. I lost over $500,000 dollars in vintage television video equipment. Color vacuum tube cameras that were use on the Ed Sullivan show. Broadcast test equipment everything from transmitters test equipment to video tape machines test equipment that could never be replaced.\r\nAnd for the county forestry, when I departed from my area, I saw a forestry truck (the type of truck loaded with water) parked in the middle of the street of Ventura and olive that their crew was taken photos. There was another truck parked on Glenrose just south from Ventura and they were taken photos. That time you could see everything from the corner of Ventura and Glenrose to Fair Oaks since everything was now burn down to the ground. No fire department support anywhere. Unbelievable!"}

I heard some people say there were houses that cost upwards of $10 million but there were also cases of houses that had their insurance policies canceled due to fire risk.  It's just that if 1,000 homes are completely destroyed, insurance claims could be in the hundreds of millions.  I don't think most insurance companies could quickly come up with that amount of money and even if they do, it will probably be the last time they would offer policies to any homeowners in those fire-prone areas.  I never thought those fires could reach down into the residential areas in Los Angeles but with the strong winds blowing embers for miles it seems it can happen.  The more area the fire covers, the fire fighters become thinned out.  How many hours can a fire fighter go without rest or sleep while fires keep popping up.  That's a scary scenario that no one is prepared for.\nI had wondered why no airdrops were being done but I didn't know they couldn't fly in heavy wind.  They need to drop fire-retardant to stop houses from easily igniting from sparks.  Four major fires all in different areas will be hard to control with limited resources."}

All of these fires are incredibly suspicious, I really hope that doesn’t happen but I get the feeling that it will. I feel so sad and heartbroken for the regular innocent people and animals who’ve lost everything or lost their lives. People who worked their entire lives to buy that house or work like a dog everyday just to rent a place and are barely scraping by. All of the family homes that were in families for generations when it was still affordable to buy a beautiful home. I can see exactly where people get the wrong idea when they see the value of a house. My father in law bought his house in Washington State in the late 90s for like $90,000. Because of the area and the neighborhood they built around it, it’s value is closer to $500,000 now. His property taxes have gone up so much over the years, my father in law is an amazing person. He’s a master carpenter who has worked his butt off doing it for almost 50 years! We are in no way rich, money wise. Unfortunately his job doesn’t offer any sort of retirement, he’s 66 years old now and still works so hard. Those are the kind of people and families I’m truly devastated for. I wish and hope nothing but the best for them, I’m so sorry for everything that you’ve lost."}

All these scumbags are still selling September 11 & Bin Laden at face value. Mid East Wars, Shootings. \nhere’s a lesson on WIND provided by TRUTJ TO POWER NUMBER 1! Miles W Mathis.\n\n[Added January 18, 2025: But back to the winds. As I said, and as you know, everyone on both sides is pushing 100mph Santa Ana winds to explain this, including the weather expert Bill Burr. One problem: there is no such thing. Look it up if you don't believe me. Start with the Beaufort Scale, where you will learn that 100mph winds are normally only found in cyclones, like hurricanes and tornados. Strong Santa Ana winds never hit 100 or even 50. They rarely gust to 40mph, but the ones in LA last week were only about 25. I know because I checked. It is quite easy to do these days, just go to one of the many weather channels and type in the zip code. 25mph is a strong wind, and I guess\n \nreally stupid people could mistake it for a 100mph wind, supposing they had never been anywhere near a 100mph wind. To give you a comparison, a gale is defined as about 40-45mph, and that can knock you over and cause 25ft waves at sea. A strong gale is 45-55mph, and that can tear shingles off your house. That wasn't happening in LA, because Santa Ana winds never hit strong gale or Beaufort 9. Beaufort 10 is full gale or storm, with winds up to 63mph. As it says at Wiki, this is almost never seen inland, and it will uproot trees and blow houses down. Beaufort 11 is up to 72mph, causing 50ft waves at sea. Even most sailors have never experienced this, and they don't want to. Anything above 73mph is hurricane, Beaufort 12, so the talking heads in LA are claiming way above hurricane force winds hit Palisades on Tuesday. Which is how I knew they were lying immediately.]"}

Year after year, communities are decimated while Newsom pours billions into ridiculous vanity projects—like the bullet train to nowhere—instead of addressing the very real and urgent safety needs of the people he’s supposed to serve. While he chases headlines, Californians are left with nothing but ashes and shattered lives.\n\nPractical solutions—like widening fire roads to ensure safer evacuations and creating temporary refuge areas for displaced families—have been sitting on the table for decades. Decades. And what has Newsom done? Nothing. His inaction, despite over 25 years of clear warnings, is not just negligent; it’s outright disgraceful.\n\nEven worse, critical public safety funding continues to be deprioritized. Seven months before the uncontrolled Palisades Fire in Los Angeles, the city's fire department budget for this fiscal year was slashed by more than $17.5 million, according to records. Instead of strengthening frontline defenses, resources are being diverted elsewhere. Mayor Karen Bass, in signing the City of Los Angeles' budget for the 2024-2025 fiscal year, further highlighted how misplaced priorities are contributing to the wildfire crisis.\n\nTo the families who have lost everything—your homes, your loved ones, your futures—you deserve leaders who actually care about your survival, not ones obsessed with their political legacy. Newsom’s empty promises and grossly misplaced priorities show a staggering disregard for the very people he was elected to protect.\n\nGovernor Newsom, your failure is killing people. Californians are dying, and you’re too busy grandstanding to do anything meaningful. Stop ignoring basic common sense. Stop wasting time and resources on pipe dreams. Start doing your job—or step aside for someone who will. FK I can do a better job! Enough is enough."}

This is the most fascist and pagan part of America, full of the prideful and those who do wickedness. Christmas is by definition syncretism and God is wholly against this. Only someone who hasn't read the Bible would dare celebrate a birthday let alone celebrate a day not even revealed in biblical scripture. Those who got away with your life, repent and compare your life, ideals and thought process to the commandments of God, do they line up? If there is no God, there is no such thing as human rights and good or evil is only subjective. Why? Because there has to be a standard beyond oneself and humanity to be  considered objective otherwise the same government who said it was illegal and punishable by death for people with dark brown pigmentation to learn to read and write where right. If there is no God when the Catholics of the dark ages killed people who had a bible in their possession to cross reference the lies they were told by the church , they weren't wrong. If there is no God, Hitler was simply trying to make the world a better place. If there is no God, the first and second law of thermodynamics is fodder (which certainly is not daft but defacto) If there is no God,  nothing can make everything. If there is no God,  the millions of people who died in the colosseums of Rome under persecution of their faith in God were just crazy and died for a lie rather than the truth by not denouncing Christ Jesus as the son of God! Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand! There is NO other book on this planet which has prophesied with 100% accuracy every single historical event that has come to pass! If you're in church now, make sure you're in a church that teaches only what is in the Bible and NOT tradition! There is only but one church in the world that has the Bible as its the final authority! There are many false churches just like there are false believers and what one man called \"Christian Atheists\" those who believe in God but live as if He doesn't exist! This is the beginning of the end , get ready because the final judgement is near! ANYONE who spends such a tremendous amount of money on a HOUSE is definitely not living a life of humility with a quiet and meek in spirit. Only the Lord knows what these people lived like to burn down their whole community. This is but a glimpse of what's going to happen when God scorched the Earth to destroy all who willed ignorance instead of truth. \n\nEcclesiastes 8:11 \"Since sentencing is not carried out speedily, the human heart is fully set to do evil.\"\n\nMalachi 4:1 \"Behold, the coming is near. Burning hot like an oven all of the prideful, yes, and those who do wickedness shall become STUBBLE. For you shall trample over the wicked, they shall become ASHES under the soles of your feet!\""}

I live here and these were hurricane force winds that came when our coastal brush was at its driest after proliferating during an unusual wet year. Our infrastructure is old and was never made to support what was needed. The aircraft which usually could support and drop water and flame retardants could not fly under extreme smoke and winds up to 100 mi per hour. Some homes were old and built before codes, some tall structures caught and held the embers. It literally was the perfect storm and it highlights the nation wide issues with insurance. The whole smelt issue just makes the politicians pointing fingers look like asses. Thanks to our amazing firefighters and the family of firefighters throughout California and ajoining states, more lives have not been lost. Early warning and evacuation systems also saved lives amongst power outages. I evacuated and am alive. Mother nature is an angry woman and has no remorse for our attempts at supremacy over the environment, no matter where you live or how much money you have. We will need help rebuilding and doing so in the best way possible. Fire and wind have always been part of the natural cycle and bring renewal and life even after destruction. Support and prayers are needed along with housing, food, and clothing. We will rebuild, but hopefully do it better and with the understanding that this is going to happen again in the future ❤"}

The images seem a little ironic in regards to the destruction we cause and were we are headed🤔  No less when your house Burns down right next to the water.🤔 I'd like to know the  Statistics in regards to how many of these people that lived in these houses trusted the same government officials in regards to covid lockdowns and vaccines? I think we could learn a lot about the hive mind mentality in regards to this tragedy. This same government officials told you to wear a mask that didn't work for safety yet couldn't put water in a  Fire hydrant. The same government officials  Told you to take an experimental vaccine  Because it protected you and other people which was a lie But couldn't fill up the reservoir that was close by🤔🤨🙄 The irony in this i hope people really start waking up because this truly saddens my soul. Meanwhile someone will be triggered by my truth telling but not  Bill Burr on Jimmy Kimmel holding water for the elites making fun of people questioning that this could have clearly been avoided. Yes it could have not saying it wouldn't have happened but it definitely wouldn't have on this scale. This scale takes real incompetence of government officials to the next level."}

I'm 83 born and raised in LA.  Since as far back as I remember, my parents loved the going to the beach and driving up and down the Pacific Coast Highway from Santa Monica To Zuma passing thru Malibu.  All those homes and families were already there since I was 4 or 5 years old.  Back then we knew some celebs lived along the beach like Cary Grant, Bing Crosby and Barbara Stanwyck.  We weren't jealous or envious of them.  We had a game trying to guess who lived in which house.  Or who was that washing their car parked in front of their garage?  But we also knew regular people lived there too.  \n\nIt was the Rivera of Southern California.  My mom's favorite thing was to have fresh Lobster Tails at one of the great seafood restaurants along the way.  One time we rented horses and rode down Topanga Canyon to the beach just to have lunch.  My parents are gone.  We did this outing frequently over the years into their mid 90's.  Now all that beauty and all those lives, and all that can be seen and experienced by others instantly evaporated by an 75mph firestorm of destruction and destroyed lives.  All thats left are memories ... some heartfelt and some horrific, and some filled with contempt."}

He said, members were trained in guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and bomb making. These are not idealists. They're insurgents in training. Karen Bass, she was not just a participant. She was a leader.\r\nShe visited Cuba repeatedly, she said, every six months.\r\nWe can verify eight times. She praised Fidel Castro, the dictator of Cuba, who was imprisoning dissenters, left a legacy of poverty and fear.\r\nIn fact, this is not just her youth. She's still there. When Castro died, she was one of them who called his death a great loss to the people of Cuba. Really?\r\nA loss to the same people who risked their lives fleeing his regime, trying to get out of Cuba?\r\nThis is Karen Bass. She's the Los Angeles mayor, one of the largest cities in the United States of America.\" GLENN BECK JANUARY 2025\r\n\r\nWHAT IS BLM?\r\n\"The goals of the Black Lives Matter organization go far beyond what most people think. But they are hiding in plain sight, there for the world to see, if only we read beyond the slogans and the innocuous-sounding media accounts of the movement.\r\nThe group’s radical Marxist agenda would supplant the basic building block of society—the family—with the state and destroy the economic system that has lifted more people from poverty than any other. Black lives, and all lives, would be harmed.\r\nTheirs is a blueprint for misery, not justice. It must be rejected.\" THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION JULY 2020\r\n\r\nWHAT DID KAREN BASS DO?\r\n\"As exclusively reported by DailyMail on Friday, a damning leaked memo has revealed that Bass demanded the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) cut an extra $49 million from its budget just one week before the wildfires broke out.\r\nThe demand was in addition to $17.6 million in cuts already included in the mayor's latest budget. The extra cuts would have shut down 16 LA fire stations and crippled the department's ability to respond to emergencies, according to the Daily Mail report.\r\nThe damning memo is dated January 6, just one day before the devastating Palisades Fire broke out.\" REDSTATE 1/10/2025"}

Here they are, promising salvation from cosmic threats like asteroids, claiming they can transport us to Mars or beyond. Yet, as they boast of their technological prowess, the Earth burns beneath their feet. California is engulfed in flames, Los Angeles suffocates under a darkened sky, and the forests, once vibrant with life, are reduced to ash. What do they offer in this moment of crisis? Not humility, not repentance, not stewardship of the Earth entrusted to them, but an escape plan as if they can flee the consequences of their corruption.\n\n\nHow small they are, these so-called saviors, in the face of Allah’s creation. They marvel at the stars, forgetting that Allah is Al-Khaliq, the Creator of all things, who fashioned the heavens and the Earth with perfect balance. They speak of terraforming Mars, yet they cannot even protect the Earth, the planet Allah has gifted them. They build rockets to escape asteroids, yet they cannot stop the fires they themselves have ignited through greed and neglect. What is the strength of man compared to the power of the One who commands the winds, the oceans, and the mountains? Truly, “And they plan, but Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners” (Quran 8:30).\n\n\nTheir arrogance blinds them to their own fragility. A single spark can ignite a wildfire that consumes entire cities, and yet they think they can conquer the stars. The Earth groans under the weight of their corruption, for Allah has warned, “Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned” (Quran 30:41). Instead of turning back to the One who holds the universe in His grasp, they dream of escaping His dominion, forgetting that there is no refuge except with Him.\n\n\nLet them look to the fires in California, to the hurricanes, to the floods, and understand their weakness. Let them see the signs of Allah’s power and remember their responsibility as stewards of this Earth. For no technology, no rocket, no escape plan can save them from the consequences of ignoring the One who created them. It is not Mars that will save humanity; it is humility, repentance, and submission to the will of Allah."}

It's such a virtue-signaling hustle since building any home literally destroys the native environment.  If he cared about the environment he wouldn't accept living in such a massive sprawling home for just a few people. All materials (like all the tons of concrete, glass, and designer furniture he used shipped from all over the world) negatively affect the environment. \n\nIf you want to be Mr. and Mrs. Eco, don't build massive modern houses, don't build and support sprawling cities with their endless miles of petroleum-based asphalt (all which exterminate all the local wildlife habitat), don't build anything permanent. Live like the plains Indians and live in a mobile teepee made of local materials. And since that's never going to happen with all these urbanites addicted to their 1001 comforts, let's drop the marketing fantasy and just embrace that we modern humans cannot avoid 95% of our impact. These CA eco warriors remind me of some recent Hollywood celebrities who took their cushy private jets across the ocean just to accept an eco award. Insert eye roll."}

Instead of addressing the urgent needs of the people, he continues to allocate billions to a costly train project—a luxury we cannot afford while lives and homes are being lost.\n\nThis is why Governor Newsom must focus on practical, life-saving solutions. A fraction of that budget could be used to widen fire roads, enabling safer and faster evacuations. Creating temporary refuge areas would provide essential shelter for those who have nowhere to go during emergencies. These are common-sense measures that could save lives and prevent future devastation.\n\nFor over 25 years, warnings about the increasing wildfire risks have gone unheeded, leaving families vulnerable and communities in despair. My heart goes out to those who have lost everything—their homes, their memories, and their loved ones. You deserve leaders who put your safety and well-being first.\n\nGovernor Newsom, it’s time to wake up. Your misplaced priorities are costing lives, and Californians are tired of waiting for action. Stop ignoring the obvious, stop deflecting responsibility, and start protecting the people who trusted you to lead. The time for empty promises is over—our lives depend on it."}

A similar number burned on the other side of the city in 2003 here in southern British Columbia.\n\nMy advise:\n1. Pressure your municipal government to cut fireguards around your neighbourhood and shut down your neighbour Goretex dog hikers objectors who don't want to travel an extra 10 minutes to walk Fido in the forest. Forests in nature burn every now and then. That's just what they do. Decades of no fires and increases in city's growing circumferences is a recipe for disaster. Our forests are overgrown, over mature and ready to burn even without the excuse of climate change.\n\n2. Do an inventory of EVERYTHING you own by making a spreadsheet of photos with each item in the photo listed with replacement value as per your insurance policy. It will take you a few days once in your lifetime but it will be the first thing the insurance company will ask for...after the fire but never before. Update it each year. Imagine the satisfaction of walking into your insurance company with a document like this and handing to your agent who is masquerading like someone who cares about you. \n\n3. Keep special heirlooms and items you seldom use in clearly marked BugOut Boxes. Stick a list to a box of stuff on display that you want to keep for quick collection.\n\n4. Keep digital photos on the cloud. Put your aluminum foil hat away as no one cares about what they are amongst the trillions of photos out there.\n\n5. Remember...it's wood, glass, nails and pipes that will be replaced. Memories are in the heart. Put a bit of cold, heartless mindset on in dealing with it. It helps.\n\nTrue story...2003 fire. A buddy had a house that needed a $20,000 new roof that he couldn't afford. The house was full of In-Laws hand-me-down furniture that he hated but his wife wouldn't part with. They were evacuated. They loaded the truck with some stuff and he told me that as he closed the door, he took one last look and thought \"I'm not going to miss a thing\".\n\nThe neighbourhood burn except for a few houses including his. He was stuck with what he had while his friends and neighbours got brand new houses and furniture."}

Claiming that the possibility of a rekindle of the New Year’s Eve as some kind of “phenomenon” is uninformed. Fires are chemistry and physics. The pyrotechnic residue from spent fireworks mixed with the ashes and charcoal of the brush sitting in direct sunlight in 90° F temps for 7 days was enough to trigger a second fire. The ruins of any fire can rekindle if the post fire environment is right for re-ignition. LAFD made the black burnt brush wet, but it dried out, and when it gets dried out from the heat and wind it breaks down and heats up. It’s called Heat of Decomposition. Remember the primary chemical ingredients in fireworks is gun powder, potassium nitrate, charcoal and sulfur. The mixture of these chemicals become just as flammable and explosive after they dry out as they were before they got wet. Once the dried gunpowder residue becomes hot enough it becomes a highly volatile accelerant that if reignited can worsen fire conditions in a brush fire quickly. All it takes to get the situation right for a rekindle is to raise the temperature of the fuels above Heat of Decomposition (under 300° F) to the pyrolytic temperature of smoke (above 300° F). \nWe got an old saying in the fire service:\n“Where There’s Smoke There’s Fire.”\nAuthor unknown (and probably prehistoric but definitely not a phenomenon).\n\nChief Hughes\nBattalion 1 (retired)\nChicago FD"}

Ultimately, anything can start a fire, but the real cause of the devastation we're seeing is mismanagement by the city, county, state... so, while the blame for starting a fire may be found, the true blame for the scale of the disaster rests on the shoulders of the elected officials."}

I\n\nIt only  took about 5 min total for this lady's home to catch fire. Her Husband told me that she had a bad habit of smoking on the couch in their converted garage, and fall asleep, dropping the butt onto the couch. I was on my way to work from lunch break and drove by and saw this woman standing outside this converted garage quietly saying, \"fire\", \"fire\", \"fire\", rather quietly, while I passed by. \n\nI noticed the smoke starting to become visible, emanating from her converted porch while parking along the curbing. I approached her at the front of her house and she was in a strange mental state and was not giving me any valid information. \n\nI then asked her if anyone was in the house, and she said, \"yes, My Husband is in the back room, and he has one leg\". I then ran up to the front door and began screaming for him to vacate, but I did not hear anyone in the back as the fire already had spread to the front door from the converted garage and the roar was becoming deafening. The front door approach was okay, at first, and about 3 minutes passed so far, but it was growing fast and I did have to crouch low to try and enter the home and look for her husband, but things quickly changed upon opening the front door and a backdraft was created that seemed to move the fire to the front instead of spreading to the back, making the front door entirely inaccessible. I began yelling for the man to go out the back,  and then I finally heard a man yelling that he was crawling out the back. \n\nI left before the fire dept came as I had to go back to work, but both husband and wife were okay, but shaken up from the fire of course. They did manage to put out the fire, but the damages to the roof and garage were excessive. I noticed volunteer groups on that property days later, and a huge group began to repair it, finishing it all up within a week so they could move back in. \n\nThe lesson I learned in all this is... You only get about 5 minutes once a couch catches on fire."}

He cares for each one of us from the womb to the tomb. Life is fragile, and we all have been given free will to choose between right and wrong at any moment, impacting ourselves and others in either positive or negative ways.\n \nEach one of us will one day give an account of our lives—our thoughts, actions, and motives. Who can stand before a holy and just God? If you didn’t know, Jesus came to save us from our sinful nature. He is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. Jesus is the only mediator between God and man, and only God can forgive sins.\n \nSin is knowing the right thing to do and not doing it. It includes things like sexual immorality, idolatry, addictions, drunkenness, lying, unforgiveness, and much more—sins that separate us from God. But the call to salvation is for everyone. Regardless of wealth, status, sexual orientation, or religious background, Jesus invites you to turn from sin and accept His gift of salvation. There’s nothing we can do to earn it; salvation is by grace alone, not through good works. Jesus paid the price for our sins on the cross so we could be restored to God.\n \nHe was crucified, with nails driven through His hands and feet, a crown of thorns on His head, and He died for our sins. But three days later, He rose from the dead—Jesus is alive! Now is the time to respond. Romans 10:9 says, “If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” It’s not the prayer itself that saves you; it’s the belief, repentance, and trust in Jesus. He is returning soon, and we must be ready to give an account.\n \nSo, turn from darkness to light, from sin to salvation, and follow Jesus. Confess your sins, repent, and start living a righteous life trusting in Him daily. Ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit, read your Bible, and stay connected to God in prayer. He’s waiting with open arms. Embrace His love and gift of eternal life today!"}

That's not to say that its not sad or that I don't care about people effected.  I care about them more than anyone because I care about their eternal soul.  And if it takes losing a home for them to repent and get right with God, then let it come.  Its better to have a home burn than to burn in hell.   So I hope that people will quit blaming global warming for this and start blaming Gavin Newsome and the people responsible.  But I also pray that people will prioritize God and other people more than materialism, wealth, greed, and comfort.  We can expect fires, hurricanes, and other horrible disasters and in more and more increasing devastation as we continue to abandon God.  Its a natural result of spitting in the eye's of God.  The liberal people who decided not to have control burns, do not know or love God; therefore, they have no common sense and are fools.  Therefore, there policies create this devastation.  And its not surprising that people who support these idiots, who largely live in LA and New York, are going to suffer the natural consequences of spitting in God's face.  I know I'll be demonized here, but that's the stone cold truth.  And until people start facing the truth, they will continue to kick against the bricks of nature's God.  Our nation needs to repent and turn back to God and then to return to common sense and morality.  Killing millions of innocent babies in the womb, murdering innocent Americans, calling marriage \"gay,\" and all the horrible things we do in this country is not without consequence.  We need to learn this lesson or else we will continue to be destroyed by natural disasters and wicked political leaders who act stupid because they do not know God.  I pray that, not only will the people affected by these fires but everyone, will repent and turn to Jesus Christ because any day could be your last.  Believe me, I know all too well."}

I had stayed up a little bit too late the night before it was also exhausted emotionally from the Palisades fire so I didn't get to watch the Eaton fire as much as I would have liked to especially because I got called into work for early the next day but holy crap it was scary. And then I think the scary star was when I woke up on Wednesday in Burbank and saw smoke from the Eaton fire just blooming over the southern from my home in Burbank. I looked outside the window and the little part of sky I could see was so dark blue I had to ask myself if there was a mountain that I could see out that window but no there wasn't. I stepped out my front door looked to the south and it was the scariest thing I think I've seen in my life and I've seen the beginnings of a tornado. It was something so scary like a severe thunderstorm color clouds in the sky with the sun behind it, looking like absolute hell on earth. It was quite freaked out I said a lot of profanities over the course of the half hour before I left for where I work in downtown Burbank. It got scarier as I went over the bridge that crosses the railroad tracks and the freeway and it was still incredibly windy. And then at work that day, The people who come 7 days a week for breakfast and have the entire 7 months I've worked at this restaurant, We started to get freaked out like if we don't see the regulars we know something's wrong. Luckily we saw the regulars but we did see very few people the rest of the day. It was like the longest 8-hour shift of my life, especially because we had no obstructions and we could see out the windows to the west so not only could we see the Eaton fire smoke looming over us we could also see the Palisades fire about 16 miles in the distance. We stood there and not only did we watch it involve over the day We could actively see the smoke moving. It was hellish and I'm so glad that I wasn't even anywhere near and evacuation zone. I think it was the next day Thursday at work or maybe Friday when everybody got the falls alarm during the Kenneth fire and I freaked out because downtown Burbank is on the other side of the mountains from mandatory evacuation zones from the Eaton fire. It also confused me because I had become aware of the Kenneth fire maybe an hour or two for my shift when it broke out, and I  had driven East to work maybe 15 minutes before and saw nothing on the mountains. A coworker told me it was a mandatory evacuation order and I truly believe that the fire had jumped La Cañada, going up the east slope of the mountain and was now creeping down at the west side of the mountain towards downtown burbank. I'm from the Midwest so I'm not very familiar with fires but I had watched the notifications as the Palisades fire grew 10x times in 20 minutes. \n\nThe alert came again and it was the note to disregard the previous alarm. An EAS tone going out to all 200 people in the big vast store is drawing as hell and when you finally have calmed yourself down hearing it again will flip you out."}

And she died in a very tragic way. Money and things they never really meant much to me, after I learned that lesson of losing my mother to the house fire. Seems in America we have become a country who only values materialism, wealth, fame, aesthetic beauty. But we don’t value anything of the things that are really important in life. Such as friends, animals, kindness, love, freedom, empathy, integrity, etcetera. And then we reward those that are greedy, selfish, self centered, famous, status in society, etcetera. I learned so much from my mother. And if I could bring her back by destroying all my possessions that I have now, I would destroy them all in a heartbeat. I guess I should feel sorry for these people that value their “things” so much. Because they will never know the happiness of having the real things that are important in our lives."}

On top of being told by officials to NOT EVACUATE from those select areas, look how many people still did how it stunned the reaction time of emergency services, therefore making such disaster worse... all because you didn't have an EMERGENCY PLAN.\n\nMaybe investing more funds into fire response services, instead of rabbit hole projects like windmills & solar would be a great idea. Also, maybe families with extra funds (That's most of y'all) should shove that 1000 sq/ft pool & 6 bedroom guesthouse project to side and build a fireproof shelter/basement.

All these scumbags are still selling September 11 & Bin Laden at face value. Mid East Wars, Shootings. \nhere’s a lesson on WIND provided by TRUTJ TO POWER NUMBER 1! Miles W Mathis.\n\n[Added January 18, 2025: But back to the winds. As I said, and as you know, everyone on both sides is pushing 100mph Santa Ana winds to explain this, including the weather expert Bill Burr. One problem: there is no such thing. Look it up if you don't believe me. Start with the Beaufort Scale, where you will learn that 100mph winds are normally only found in cyclones, like hurricanes and tornados. Strong Santa Ana winds never hit 100 or even 50. They rarely gust to 40mph, but the ones in LA last week were only about 25. I know because I checked. It is quite easy to do these days, just go to one of the many weather channels and type in the zip code. 25mph is a strong wind, and I guess\n \nreally stupid people could mistake it for a 100mph wind, supposing they had never been anywhere near a 100mph wind. To give you a comparison, a gale is defined as about 40-45mph, and that can knock you over and cause 25ft waves at sea. A strong gale is 45-55mph, and that can tear shingles off your house. That wasn't happening in LA, because Santa Ana winds never hit strong gale or Beaufort 9. Beaufort 10 is full gale or storm, with winds up to 63mph. As it says at Wiki, this is almost never seen inland, and it will uproot trees and blow houses down. Beaufort 11 is up to 72mph, causing 50ft waves at sea. Even most sailors have never experienced this, and they don't want to. Anything above 73mph is hurricane, Beaufort 12, so the talking heads in LA are claiming way above hurricane force winds hit Palisades on Tuesday. Which is how I knew they were lying immediately.]"}

In fact, this concept has been in the works for a long time. It revolves around creating sustainable communities that are higher in density, use resources more efficiency, and consume less energy. A critical branch of this includes more public gathering space for things such as parks and farmers markets and neighborhood amphitheaters. More transit hubs which people out of cars is also part of new communities. And local zoning ordinances will be over-ridden in order to stop Nimby-ism and exclusion. \r\n\r\nWith the destruction of entire neighbors, there are great new opportunities. New types of communities can rise from the ashes. People whose homes were destroyed might find themselves with a very tempting offer of getting a new home, built and paid for by the government, where homeowners would live in sustainable building complexes shared with other homeowners. Let’s not be afraid of this, people need to be open to Newsom’s ideas and the creative solutions that his team is forwarding. A new model of living can help us adjust to global warming while fostering a healthier and more connected and inclusive society."}

That would be poetic justice. The wealthy. people who are virtue signaling by driving electric cars are actually creating more hazards and pollution. And why should it be transported offsite to some remote location, spewing toxins all the way, because you know they are not going to be safely contained in the trucks. Perhaps a pit should be dug in each neighborhood where there was a fire, and the debris from that fire contained in the neighborhood from which it came. The people in the poor areas where the debris is taken did not have electric cars, so why should they be poisoned by lithium? Perhaps it should stay in the Palisades from where it came."}

There are so many different patrols, private, local, national in the SM Palisades area, but are they at all coordinated with a plan & back ups? Why not have a local SOLUTION support gathering, (not the place or style for screaming accusations & finger pointing from a podium- nice coffee, some snacks, shared pens & a white board) including residents still residing, sharing info & plans on unknowns' descriptions recently spotted, Q's on who to call & best actions to take in circumstances, networking w vetted avail contractors etc offering donated or discounted services directly (& a point person we locals can go to & say \"I can help out w ____, send me where you need me\" then vetted by), organized debris removal help, establishing core neighborhood connections that were in place before the fires : neighborhood watch captain, local transportation, presidents of local chapters that were active in the community- keeping the core community strong & not allowing intrusive encroaching govt ... so what works vs what doesn't  ... idk we need a lot of community strength & diverse input/support, to avoid being overwhelmed, over powered & over taken in these moments of confusion & desperation 🥺 Govt tends not to have our back, & their own plan, so like the ones able to help water a neighbor's property too, & offering help now, we gotta strengthen each others backbones with our physical & intellectual support, b.c the outcome of how this city- county comes out of this, will affect all of our areas really.\n Like we need a soc media forum on what it really means rn for someone who has a 6 million dollar propert & a 2 million insurance, & decides just to sell what's left and buy elsewhere ... ie space for developers to take over. Or what it means for $1.5 million homes, b.c those families probably don't have much savings or wiggle room, or what it means from generational homes bought in the 70's or sooner, who don't have the financial options, how can they understand options & create strength. Or if all of the historical & other reasons for permitting restrictions are now burnt up, so developers have free rein to build up, or create cookie cutter town home subdivisions on far smaller plots. Or if as fights btwn who's responsible for water, electrical (& the argument/need/outcome of now running electrical underground, since all the very old above ground electricity poles have now burnt down & don't need to be saved due to old neighborhood set ups) come up, b.c the govt is responsible for some portion in the street, the utilities like Edison etc are responsible for some portion, then the homeowner makes a choice of what services, cable are supplied to new build ... idk, it's a complicated mess people should know the truth about & have help understanding so their not overrun & the game played on them with developers overtaking & actually recreating OUR city s . Like a developer will have a connection & stronghold with city codes & planners, in redefining how the previous terms now apply, as they push out local voices & opposition requesting true communities that work even better back! \nSorry, too much scrolling & too much coffee ... not sorry 🫤"}

The first time they used it they had the power too high and it flipped cars upside down and melted aluminum wheels to liquid. Some forest fire. Same here with all the green trees. People want the government to investigate these fires are the same ones doing it. These D.E.W.s can be put on drones, ships, airplanes, anywhere you have enough electricity to power it."}

They were prepared with mask, fire prof jackets and small portable oxygen tanks. they teamed up went to the roof and spray water all over their surroundings and stop one small tiny fire at a time. The they simply focus to guard one direction and move from time to time to other spot. The intense part only lasted 4-5 hours and when the smokes clear the fire next door are small and manageable.. The fire in the residential area was cause by small embers that are managable. If people only people calm down and guard their houses with water, the damage should be less. Men should guard their homes while women evacuate cause they would only cry, shout and panic. Most importantly I think the panic warnings to evacuate early made by the authority did the real damage."}

There remained just too many housing units there that continued to qualify for the cheapest property tax rates as mandated by the State of California's 1978 Proposition 13!  In one fell, who-could'a thunkit swoop and as a consequence of the ALTADENA CONFLAGRATION, more than 2/3rds of those Proposition 13 homes have burned down or otherwise unrecoverably been damaged. \r\n\r\nWhen homeowners rebuild, the State of California -- in backstabbing fashion -- will declare all Prop' 13 covered fire rebuilds to ALL be NEW STRUCTURES.  This means all new tax-standards, and that Prop' 13's 1978 tax break has suddenly become functionally extinct.  All this is because the Satanic threesome of the State, the County, and the City of Pasadena conspired to ignore their fire-abatement duties, leading to the wholesale burn out of all them tax-avoiding property-owners.\r\n\r\nPasadena is also going to make a grab at incorporating Altadena into Pasadena as a coopted tax-base.  That's the major reason it cooperated so completely with this community burn-out conspiracy.  With all them condemned properties being wholly unlivable, the former residents of those homes will now be former voters of Altadena.  This will make it so much cheaper for the City of Pasadena to bribe-out the remaining residents to sell cheap to the City's incorporation process."}

TBF our house caught flames likely within 40 minutes of the fire first breaking out and it was total pandamonium by where I was (I lived within a half mile of where it started). I can understand folks in my area (Way east of Lake at Altadena and New York Drive) not having any warning but those in west Altadena should have had WAY MORE NOTICE. This fire spread out of control for about 24 hours, there is zero excuse for those wireless alerts to have not come through. If the police/FD didn't knock on our doors to tell us to leave then there is no way they did it for the condensed parts of Altadena. I was able to see the flames about 15 minutes before the burning embers started raining on us, others did not have that luxury of being able to SEE the fire thousands of feet away before getting to grab some things to leave. Most had the warning of fire being at their doortstep. We got out the moment burning embers were landing and after having returned to see the damage we're lucky for it. We only had about 5 minutes until our house went up most likely."}
