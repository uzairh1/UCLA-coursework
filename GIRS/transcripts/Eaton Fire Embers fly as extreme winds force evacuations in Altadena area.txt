AND THEN SO IS LEANNE SUTER
THERE. THESE ARE BOTH. WE'RE
TRYING TO SHOW YOU HOW
DEVASTATING THIS FIRE IS QUICKLY
BECOMING. AND LEANNE AGAIN, IN
ORDER TO SOLIDIFY HER SIGNAL,
SHE IS ON AN EIGHT SECOND DELAY.
SO HAVE SOME PATIENCE AS WE
THROW TO LEANNE. SO LEANNE, TAKE
IT AWAY.
>> THANK YOU GUYS. THE WIND HERE
IS UNBELIEVABLE. YOU JUST HEARD
DALLAS TALKING ABOUT HOW STRONG
THESE GUSTS ARE. AND I CAN TELL
YOU WE ARE EXPERIENCING THEM
FIRSTHAND. WE JUST HAD A GUST
LITERALLY JUST A COUPLE OF
SECONDS AGO THAT I'M GOING TO
SAY IS PROBABLY AROUND 50 MILES
AN HOUR, IF NOT MORE. DUNCAN, I
DON'T I MEAN, MY PHOTOGRAPHER,
WE BOTH HAD TO HOLD ON TO EACH
OTHER JUST TO STAND UP IN THE
WIND. IT SOUNDS LIKE A FREIGHT
TRAIN IS COMING THROUGH THE
TREES HERE. LIKE HERE COMES
ANOTHER ONE. YOU CAN HEAR IT
KIND OF BUILDING AS IT STARTS.
AND THEN THESE WINDS REALLY HIT
HARD, THESE GUSTS. AND THAT IS
THE PROBLEM FOR ALL OF THESE
FIREFIGHTERS. AS WE LOOK UP THE
HILL HERE, IT'S HARD TO SEE
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE.
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE WIND
WILL KIND OF BLOW OUT THE SMOKE.
AND YOU CAN SEE THE FIRE MAKING
ITS WAY ALL THE WAY UP THE HILL.
BUT RIGHT NOW, THERE'S JUST SO
MUCH SMOKE IN THE AIR, YOU CAN
BARELY MAKE IT OUT. BUT WE HAVE
SEEN WHERE THERE ARE HOTSPOTS
NOW BECAUSE SO MANY EMBERS HAD
COME FROM THE FIRE BURNING IN
EATON CANYON. ALL OF THOSE
EMBERS HAVE BLOWN UP ONTO THE
STREET ACROSS THE STREET. I
SHOULD SAY WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY
HOUSES ACROSS THE STREET YET ON
FIRE, BUT WE HAVE SEEN WHERE AT
LEAST SOME OF THE BRUSH, SOME OF
THE TREES ACROSS THE WAY HAVE
BEEN ON FIRE. THERE IS A
TREMENDOUS RESPONSE BY PASADENA
POLICE AND OTHER AGENCIES COMING
UP IN HERE AND GOING THROUGH THE
AREA WITH THEIR ANNOUNCEMENTS ON
URGING EVERYONE TO EVACUATE
IMMEDIATELY, WARNING OF THE
DANGER. AND THIS TRULY CAME UP
SO QUICKLY. SO MANY FOLKS UP
HERE REALLY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TIME TO GRAB ANYTHING. THEY HAD
TO JUST JUMP.
>> HERE COMES ONE OF THESE GUSTS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YEP, THESE
THINGS ARE SO STRONG.
>> I HAVE COVERED A LOT OF FIRES
IN MY TIME OUT HERE IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA. AND I HAVE TO TELL
YOU, I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ONE
LIKE THIS IN TERMS OF THE GUSTS.
I'VE BEEN IN WINDY FIRES AND
SANTA ANA BLAZES, BUT THESE
GUSTS ARE EXTRAORDINARY. AND YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S FUELING
THESE FIRES BOTH HERE IN
ALTADENA AND EATON CANYON. AND
THEN OF THE FIRE IN THE PACIFIC
PALISADES. THE WIND IS VICIOUS
AND THAT IS WHAT IS SPREADING
THE FLAMES. AND AGAIN, BLOWING
ALL OF THOSE EMBERS OUT INTO THE
INTO THE AREA. I'M GOING TO WALK
AROUND THIS WAY NOW THAT WE
DUNCAN, WE CAN WALK A LITTLE BIT
AND SEE IF WE CAN SHOW YOU
THERE'S SO MANY FIREFIGHTERS AND
ENGINES THAT HAVE MOVED INTO
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'RE ALONG
CANYON CLOSED ROAD. AND WE GOT
TO WHEN THOSE WINDS COME IN, YOU
REALLY HAVE TO HOLD YOURSELF
STEADY. ALL OF THE ENGINES HAVE
COME IN, AND THEY'RE JUST
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE HOMES
THAT LINE THE CANYON HERE. WE
SAW THEM COMING, SOME OF THE
FLAMES COMING UP IN THE BACKYARD
OF SOME OF THESE HOUSES, BUT
THEY'VE MADE A REALLY GOOD
STAND. THE STRUCTURAL PROTECTION
HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS. SO FAR. WE
HAVE NOT SEEN ANY HOMES THAT
HAVE CAUGH
