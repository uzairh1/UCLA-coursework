Scrape X posts abt. Eaton/Palisades fires -- NLP processing
-- need timestamps
Old Jupyter ntebook code from Twitter times
Different timelines by type of fire
Detection time -- how long did it take to detect (start of fire ---> notification/X/news/etc)
Preparation time -- how long did it take for them to prepare people to leave
Evacuation time -- how long does it take to evacuate
API of X is partly free, full access is not...
Need tweets from only days of fire and 1-2 days after
Research X API -- start from the free version
	If we can filter out to the posts we are interested in, $200/mo. rate is fine
