Umbrella organization
3 institute centers and 3 research units
PSIM, Phoenix, Fire Risk Management, Hybrid Casual Logic, Slack, GitLab
Projects:
	1. Pipeline system integrity monitoring (extend to water pipes, electricity; things that may not corrode; change parameters) 
        2. Fire risk management of power lines with PG&E; can filter on risk; how mitigation actions reduces risk; build simpler version on PISM for easily distributable versions for other companies
        3. 
        --> 4. Optimize evacuation time/plan during fires; fire propagation; do Zoom meetings with people in October with industry
        5. PHOENIX Human Reliability Analysis - failure within an organization
        6. Website redesign
        8. AI tools workshop (open to public; class?) -- maybe starting fall quarter 2025); learning curve is fast
        9. Autonomous driving vehicles (maybe)


Hybrid causal logic software:
- every software is built on this as an engine
- event, sequences, fault trees (top level - even; bottom level; causes) - connect logical gates - defined start and end
- Bayesian networks - no set start or end point
- quantify completed models and see probability of end states
- improve UI/UX, squash bugs

Hydrogen project:
-transmission lines, distribution lines, how existing equipment performs when pumping hydrogen into it (component model does this)
-risk models (component model, pipe model (failures over time) system model (combine component models)), performance models (energy flow (reduction in flow; pipe-specific), ThermoFlex (for non-pipe components); proprietary), optimization models (technoeconomic analysis; under development; takes other models to do its work)

WISE (Wildfire Safe Egress Planning Software Platform)
- critical roads for evacuation / vehicles over time / add lanes to roads / high-risk communities
- models fire propagation on Windows with dynamic and static inputs in HFire
- does not account for time of day affecting traffic / firefighting activity
- work with more customizable parameters in Sumo (Simulation of Urban Mobility)
- access to socioeconomic data of residents who live in area

Phoenix 
- human reliability assessment tool
- human error proababilities in complex systems
- work with NRA in Japan
- guide user through questionaire when adding critical functions

Probability Risk Assessment Model
	Critical Functions
	Crew Response Trees
	Fault Trees (human failure modeling; show why critical tasks fail)
	PIFs (8 Bayesian networks)
	...
Use in nuclear power plants, aviation emergencies, healthcare erros, gas/oil leaks, space system/launch control, cybersecutiy incidents

Excel version/custom templates/UI and UX improvements
